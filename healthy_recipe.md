   - 1 cucumber, diced
   - 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
   - 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
   - 1 cup Kalamata olives, pitted

   - 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
   - 1 tsp dried oregano
   - Salt and pepper to taste

3. **For the Tzatziki Sauce**:
   - 1 cup plant-based yogurt (such as coconut or almond)
   - 1 cucumber, grated and drained
   - 2 cloves garlic, minced
   - 1 tbsp olive oil
   - 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
   - 1 tsp dried dill
   - Salt to taste

#### Preparation Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetarian Moussaka**:
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Salt the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
   - In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
   - Add the cooked lentils to the skillet. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and vegetable broth (if using). Simmer for about 20 minutes until the mixture thickens.
   - In another skillet, heat the remaining olive oil and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Set aside.
   - In a baking dish, layer the sliced potatoes at the bottom, followed by half of the eggplant slices. Add the lentil mixture, then the remaining eggplant on top.
   - Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top and spread it out.
   - Bake for 45-50 minutes until the top is golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.

2. **Prepare the Greek Salad**:
   - In a large bowl, combine the chopped romaine, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, Kalamata olives, and plant-based feta cheese.
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

3. **Prepare the Tzatziki Sauce**:
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the plant-based yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, dill, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate until serving.

#### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve generous portions of vegetarian moussaka on each plate accompanied by a side of Greek salad.
- Add a small bowl of tzatziki sauce on the side for dipping or drizzling over the moussaka.
- For drinks, consider serving a crisp white wine or a refreshing sparkling water with lemon.
- Consider garnishing the plate with fresh parsley or mint for added flavor and presentation.

### Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:
- **Ground Beef or Lamb**: Replaced with lentils for a plant-based protein that adds texture and heartiness to the dish without sacrificing flavor.
- **Beef or Lamb Stock/Wine**: Substituted with vegetable broth or retained red wine (optional) to maintain depth of flavor.
- **Feta Cheese**: Swapped with plant-based feta cheese to keep the dish vegetarian-friendly while still providing a similar creamy texture and tangy taste.
- **Greek Yogurt**: Changed to plant-based yogurt to ensure the tzatziki sauce remains dairy-free while still being creamy and delicious.

Enjoy this delightful vegetarian Greek dinner that brings the flavors of Greece to your home in a healthy, plant-based way!
