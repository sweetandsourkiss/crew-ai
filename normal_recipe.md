   - 1 cucumber, grated and drained
   - 2 cloves garlic, minced
   - 1 tbsp olive oil
   - 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
   - 1 tsp dried dill
   - Salt to taste

#### Preparation Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Moussaka**:
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Salt the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
   - In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
   - Add the ground meat to the skillet. Cook until browned. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and red wine (if using). Simmer for about 20 minutes until the mixture thickens.
   - In another skillet, heat the remaining olive oil and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Set aside.
   - In a baking dish, layer the sliced potatoes at the bottom, followed by half of the eggplant slices. Add the meat mixture, then the remaining eggplant on top.
   - Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top and spread it out.
   - Bake for 45-50 minutes until the top is golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.

2. **Prepare the Greek Salad**:
   - In a large bowl, combine the chopped romaine, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese.
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

3. **Prepare the Tzatziki Sauce**:
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, dill, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate until serving.

#### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve generous portions of moussaka on each plate accompanied by a side of Greek salad.
- Add a small bowl of tzatziki sauce on the side for dipping or drizzling over the moussaka.
- For drinks, consider serving a crisp white wine or traditional Greek ouzo.
- Consider garnishing the plate with fresh parsley or mint for added flavor and presentation. 

Enjoy a delightful Greek dinner that brings the flavors of Greece to your home!
