   - 1 cup sugar
   - 1 teaspoon cinnamon
   - 1 cup water
   - 1 cup honey
   - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

#### Preparation Instructions:

1. **Tzatziki:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, minced garlic, olive oil, and white wine vinegar.
   - Mix well and season with salt and pepper. Adjust seasoning according to taste.
   - Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors meld. Garnish with fresh dill or mint before serving.

2. **Chicken Souvlaki:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
   - Add the cubed chicken to the marinade, ensuring all pieces are coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to overnight).
   - Preheat the grill (or a grill pan) over medium-high heat.
   - Thread the marinated chicken onto the skewers. Grill for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks.

3. **Greek Salad:**
   - In a large salad bowl, combine cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, olives, and feta cheese.
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.
   - Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

4. **Baklava:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - In a bowl, combine walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon.
   - Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough in the dish, brushing each sheet with melted butter.
   - Spread a layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo. Repeat layers, alternating between phyllo and walnut mixture, ending with 8 layers of phyllo on top.
   - Cut the baklava into diamond shapes before baking. Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden and crisp.
   - While the baklava is baking, combine water, honey, and vanilla in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
   - Once the baklava is done, immediately pour the syrup over it and let it cool completely.

#### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve the tzatziki with warm pita bread for dipping as an appetizer.
- Arrange the grilled chicken souvlaki on a platter with lemon wedges for squeezing over the top.
- Serve the Greek salad on the side, drizzled with extra olive oil if desired.
- For dessert, cut the baklava into diamond shapes and serve at room temperature, perhaps with a side of Greek coffee or herbal tea.
