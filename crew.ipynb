      "On a Friday at Doherty Memorial High School in Worcester, Massachusetts, 14-year-old Harris Wolobah was handed a small coffin-shaped box, emblazoned with a skull and snake, that contains a single spicy tortilla chip called the One Chip Challenge.Paqui, a Hershey company-owned brand that makes the chip, doesn't have a measurement for how spicy its product is or a Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) rating that shows the level of pungency of a pepper.But the chip is made with the Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers, which are rated at about 1.6 million and 1.4 million SHU, respectively. Jalapeno peppers, in comparison, range from 2,500 to 8,000 SHU.The \"challenge\" is simple: Eat the whole chip in one sitting, and see how long you can last without desperately grabbing a glass of milk or water.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Health experts have already warned about the potential side effects of participating in the One Chip Challenge: vomiting, stomach pain, difficulty breathing, and even cardiac arrest. But Wolobah, like so many others, most likely either had no clue about the warnings or brushed it off.Plus, countless others have already tried the challenge and shared their experience on YouTube. Pain quickly ensues but the participants seemed to come out of it okay.When Wolobah ate the chip, the sophomore must have had an especially adverse reaction. According to Harris's mother, Lois Wolobah, he fainted and was sent to the nurse's office that day.\"When I went there, he was lying down and I said, 'What was the chip you ate?'\" his mother told WBZ TV. Wolobah showed his mom the Paqui brand One Chip Challenge. His father, Amos, said his son didn't have any pre-existing condition, at least to his knowledge, he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Wolobah died in his home hours later. Autopsy results have not yet been released, and the family and Hershey did not respond to a request for comment. But the Wolobahs are pointing the blame squarely at the One Chip Challenge.Paqui in response said in a statement that it's working with retailers to \"remove the product from shelves.\"It's unclear if the heat had anything to do with Wolobah's death, but the challenge's mere existence points to a uniquely American fascination with spice.At restaurants, sweat-inducing heat is almost expected on the menu. In the aisles of grocery stores, shoppers can choose from a dizzying selection of hot sauces. And in South Carolina, a farm is singlehandedly responsible for developing one of the hottest peppers ever eaten by mankind. The farm recently just topped its own record with a pepper rated at more than 2 million Scoville Heat Units.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The demand has sometimes veered into the realm of morbid curiosity. Online, content creators farm for attention by taking part in extreme food challenges, expecting the pain, while millions watch.Here's how we got here.It all began with an Italian explorerThe very brief summary of the chile peppers' origin starts somewhere in South America around Bolivia and Brazil, according to Stephanie Walker, an extension vegetable specialist at New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute.When humans discovered peppers and their kick — a sensation, not a flavor — thousands of years ago, they immediately latched onto the fruit as a medicinal crop, and through human selection, a variety of chile peppers of different sizes and shapes started to appear, Walker told Business Insider.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the chile pepper's global proliferation began with a familiar name: Christopher Columbus.Columbus was looking for black peppercorns — a highly sought-after fruit at the time — but instead encountered a red plant that had a similar pungency, according to Walker. Hence the reason why we call the red fruit, chile peppers, despite having no relationship to the black peppercorn.Once the Italian explorer took the seed back to the Old World, the fruit took off.\"Many countries, especially Asian countries, African countries, really embraced it and started developing their own particular types of chile based on the flavors, the heat level, and other attributes that they preferred,\" the professor said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "At least since the 20th century, the US has consistently seen a steady increase in chile pepper demand, especially as immigration opened up in the country.Between 1980 and 2020, chile pepper consumption increased more than twofold, from three pounds to seven pounds per person according to a 2021 research paper from the New Mexico State University's Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business.\n",
      " Related stories\n",
      "\"Consumption of peppers is going up in the United States, and it has been steadily for some time,\" Walker said.By 2020, according to the USDA, the chile pepper market was valued at $100 million. \n",

      "A world recordEd Currie — arguably the godfather of extremely hot chile peppers for his hand in developing the world's hottest chiles — traces his fascination with spice back to his college days in the '80s when his parents had to give him a reality check.\"My parents told me I was going to die of heart disease or cancer, and I had better do something about it if I wanted to keep on living the lifestyle that I was leading,\" Currie told Business Insider. Currie, at that time, was a \"full-blown alcoholic and addict.\"His habits didn't come to a sudden halt, but he did discover his interest in peppers during visits to the school library at absurd hours. In particular, Currie was piqued by the chile peppers' medicinal qualities. Perhaps, he thought, they contained the key to keep him chugging along.\"I found out that the lowest indices of cancer and heart disease were around the equator from the two tropics,\" he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Currie began sending letters all over the world, mostly to embassies, requesting samples of chiles or chile seeds. The internet still had a few years before it truly took off.After a brief stint as a bank trust officer and a move to South Carolina, Currie opened a small booth at a flea market slinging homemade salsa using peppers he grew in his yard. In 2003, Puckerbutt Pepper Company was born. Currie by then also was a recovering addict for several years.\n",
      " Ed Currie holds his Guinness Book of World Records certification for his new Pepper X.\n",
      " Jeffrey Collins/AP\n",
      "It was at his farm in Fort Mills, where Currie developed two of the hottest peppers in the world — at least according to Guinness World Records.In 2013, he set a world record with his Carolina Reaper pepper, which was recorded then with an average of 1.6 million Scoville Heat Units — just about the same pungency as police pepper spray, according to The Associated Press.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In October, he broke his own record again after patiently waiting more than a decade for someone to dethrone his Reaper. The pepper, called Pepper X, measures at about 2.7 million SHU.The South Carolina farmer gave three reasons why he and his team created peppers that are essentially suitable for torture.One, \"because we can,\" he told Business Insider.Two, Currie's interest in the chile pepper's medicinal qualities persists.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "And, three, \"for flavor,\" he says.Currie doesn't enjoy burning himself up more than anyone else, although he's likely developed an extraordinary tolerance over the years testing hot peppers.The challenges that are spawned from his product, including the One Chip Challenge that so happens to be seasoned with the Reaper, might make for effective marketing, but Currie doesn't care to participate.\"I don't do those challenges 'cause they're stupid,\" he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Instead, developing a hotter pepper is part of a business model that would allow him to sell, for example, a hotter sauce with less pepper he says, but also, believe it or not, about creating a better-tasting product.\"The philosophy for me is how can I take something that's already popular and make it taste better,\" he said.Make it hotter, chefFor as long as Roberto Santibañez was based in the US, the chef of almost four decades recalls Americans having a unique affinity to spicy foods.Santibañez, a Mexico City native who opened three restaurants in his hometown, moved to New York City in 1996, where he would later open Fonda in 2009 serving contemporary Mexican food.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "When his family got a taste of his spin on his native cuisine, they were shocked by the levels of heat.In Mexico and in school at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, Santibańez felt that restaurants and chefs cooked with spice but with a bit of caution.\n",
      " Related stories\n",
      "In the US, however, Santibańez has to remember: \"People really go for it.\"\"I think what I've experienced is if you promise people with wordings like, 'This is a spicy sauce,' then people really want it spicy,\" he told Business Insider. \"You can not fail them.\"\n",

      "Some Fonda patrons ask for more heat on top of the hot salsas already served at his restaurant, Santibañez said, and he'll oblige by giving them diced habanero, a pepper rated at 150,000 to 350,000 SHU. In his cookbooks, the chef will advise home cooks not to be afraid to add more spice, understanding what his audience expects.Americans' high tolerance for spice at restaurants can also be charted with the explosion of the Nashville Hot Chicken scene.The dish — generally, fried chicken slathered with a cayenne-pepper-based sauce or paste and typically served with pickles and white bread — has been around for several decades, perhaps even as far back as the 1930s, according to NPR.Prince's Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville is often cited as the originator. The lore behind the recipe is said to have involved a woman creating the dish to punish her cheating partner, Thornton Prince, the great-uncle of the restaurant's owner, Andre Prince.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In the past decade, however, the hot chicken appears to have received renewed attention with headlines on how the Nashville Hot Chicken is exploding in popularity.One man responsible for the hot chicken's prominence in southern California is Johnny Ray Zone, a Los Angeles native with a childhood love for spicy food and snacks.\"I was a big fan of Hot Cheetos, even though they're not spicy,\" Zone told Business Insider. \"I ate so many of those I had to get my appendix cut out.\"After his father's untimely death, Zone, who by now had worked his way up from dishwasher to executive chef, took a trip to Nashville and fell in love with the iconic hot chicken dish.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "LA needed this, Zone thought. In 2014, he started Howlin' Rays out of a food truck, serving Nashville hot chicken quarters with side dishes such as braised collard greens and a mac and cheese salad.The simple genius behind Howlin' Rays and its eventual \"viral success,\" as The Los Angeles Times described, was putting the hot chicken in sandwich form — something Nashville did not have at the time, according to Zone.\"Once we did that, then it took off,\" he said.\n",
      " Chef Johnny Ray Zone, left, prepares Nashville Hot Chicken at LA Food Fests 2016.\n",
      " Tara Ziemba/Getty Images\n",
      "But one part of the Nashville Hot Chicken experience Zone made sure to preserve was offering different levels of spice, going from mild all the way up to \"howlin'\" and \"howlin' plus plus,\" which is off-menu.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In Nashville, every hot chicken restaurant offers different levels of spice and might have a unique name for each level, Zone said. And each restaurant had its own take on what their level of \"hot\" was.\"That's part of the lure of hot chicken,\" he said.This doesn't mean that hoards of customers are coming in requesting the top three spice levels available. Zone said that they're actually \"not that popular.\"But when first-time customers do feel adventurous, Zone makes sure to give them a small sample of what to expect.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\"If people hear so much stuff about us, and it's their first time trying it, we don't want their experience to be ruined,\" Zone said. \"And we keep it authentic for how hot it is in Nashville. We don't want to dumb it down just for sales.\"A nuanced heatNovelty chip challenges, extreme peppers, and hot chicken satisfy the appetite of a small base of thrill seekers — while millions of others just watch — but our dishes aren't necessarily getting hotter.In fact, the pendulum could be swinging the other way.Denise Purcell, vice president of content and education of Specialty Food Association, which highlights trends in global, artisanal foods, told Business Insider that more and more food retailers and purveyors are thinking about how to incorporate heat to complement the foods we eat rather than overpowering our experience.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\"The trend seemed to be the hotter, the better — like ghost pepper and whatever the hottest pepper is,\" Purcell said. \"Let's see if people could handle it. And that is giving way a little bit to this more nuanced heat idea, where it's not just all about burning your tongue and seeing what your tolerance is. It's heat that enhances the flavor. It's things like hot honey we see now in a lot of menus and a lot of packaged products.\"The push to incorporate a more nuanced heat is also being commercialized, as fast food companies roll out sweet and spicy products or sauces.Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen intermittently brings back its hot honey sauce and chicken. McDonald's last month released its Sweet & Spicy Jam sauce for a limited time, which incorporates Szechuan peppercorn and cayenne pepper, according to the fast food restaurant.For Zone, the spicy foods he's intimately familiar with are dishes from one of many Thai restaurants that dot Los Angeles and have incorporated a balance of sweet and spicy like larb or yum nua.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\"In all these different Thai classics, the sugar balances out the spice,\" he said. \"And so how long have they been serving that? Hundreds of years.\"\n",

      "Different YouTube challenge video ideas\n",
      "YouTube challenge videos have been around since the dawn of time (around 2005). These videos are a great way to have fun, engage your target audience, and reach YouTube influencer status. So, let’s jump in!\n",
      "Food Challenges\n",
      "Food challenges are among the most popular challenge videos. We’ve all tried swallowing a spoonful of cinnamon at some point in our lives, right? Maybe eating a ghost pepper? No? Well, neither one of them is very pleasant. Thankfully, not all food Youtube challenges are as uncomfortable as those two. \n",
      "Ghost Pepper Challenge\n",
      "If you decide to take on the ghost pepper challenge, here’s what you need to know about the ghost pepper and why it might just be worth the pain.\n",
      "The ghost pepper is an extremely hot pepper from South America. As one of the hottest peppers out there, it has a heat rating of over 1 million Scoville units. That means it’s hotter than a habanero pepper. Be sure to have a glass of milk handy!\n",
      "Guess-the-Flavor Challenge\n",
      "Put your tastebuds to the test with the Guess-the-Flavor Challenge! In this challenge, you put on a blindfold and eat some flavored food (i.e., candy, Fanta, chips, etc.). You can make it more fun by creating a prize for guessing correctly!\n",
      "Pizza Challenge\n",
      "The pizza challenge involves putting different ingredients into opaque containers.\n",
      "Participants then randomly select containers and create their pizza from the ingredients in the bag.\n",
      "The real challenge is having to eat your creation.\n",
      "Gummy Food vs. Real Food\n",
      "The gummy vs. real food challenge requires two people, each with two versions of some type of food: one real and one gummy. Each puts a covered tray in front of them – one tray has real food, and the other has gummy food. Whichever tray they’ve chosen is the one they have to eat!\n",
      "This challenge may seem easy, but remember that there are FULL-SCALE gummy pizzas out there. It makes your jaw hurt just thinking about it.\n",
      "Chubby Bunny\n",
      "The Chubby Bunny challenge is one of those classic YouTube challenges that just isn’t going away. Don’t let the name fool you, it’s a pretty hard challenge! It involves putting marshmallows in your mouth, and after each marshmallow, you say the words “Chubby Bunny.” Warning: your cheeks may hurt from all the laughter!\n",
      "Cinnamon Challenge\n",
      "This is one for the history books. The Cinnamon Challenge has been around for at least a decade, and as far as we’re concerned, it’s still getting views! All you’ve got to do is swallow a spoonful of cinnamon, and may the odds be in your favor. \n",
      "As a tip: don’t take any breaths while doing this challenge. \n",
      "Eat it or Wear it\n",
      "The Eat it or Wear it Challenge gets pretty messy. You put a variety of different types of foods in opaque bags, so you cannot tell what they are. Then, you give each bag a number.\n",
      "Participants then choose bags (or go numerically) one at a time. You have to eat whatever food is in the bag. If you don’t want to eat it, then be prepared to wear it.\n",
      "The winner is the person that is wearing the least food.\n",
      "Exploding Watermelon\n",
      "Not only is this challenge viral on YouTube. You’ll still see it on TikTok and Instagram. The Exploding Watermelon Challenge involves putting elastic bands around a watermelon. You keep adding elastic bands until the watermelon explodes. The suspense for this challenge is intense. We recommend doing this outdoors.\n",
      "McDonald’s Roulette Challenge\n",
      "McDonald’s Roulette is a fun way for you to mix up your next visit to McDonald’s.\n",
      "You just need to go to the drive-through and order the same thing as the car in front.\n",
      "You may get an order for a family of seven, or you may just get a black coffee. It’s all a part of the fun!\n",
      "Pancake Art Challenge\n",
      "Collins Key popularized this challenge, but you don’t need to go to the extreme levels he goes to on his channel.\n",
      "It’s a fairly self-explanatory task. It’s a battle between who can make the best pancake by just using pancake mix and frying them.\n",
      "You can make this activity more fun and your artwork more colorful if you use food coloring in different squeeze bottles with batter, so you start painting in the frying pan.\n",
      "Sour vs. Sweet\n",
      "For this challenge, in each turn, you will have to randomly pick between eating sweet or spicy food. This challenge works better in couples.\n",
      "SQUID GAME Honeycomb Candy Challenge\n",
      "One of the most famous scenes of the “Squid Game” show on Netflix is the Honeycomb Candy Challenge.\n",
      "The most challenging part is making the candy! Also called Dalgona candy (recipe here), the goal is to use a needle or toothpick to separate the inside shape from the outside of the candy.\n",
      "Oh, and you have a time limit of 10 minutes.\n",
      "At least you don’t have the same penalty as the contestants had in “Squid Game.”\n",
      "Spicy vs. Extreme Spicy Food Challenge\n",
      "For this food challenge, there are two plates with food. One is extra spicy, and the other is just your average-joe spicy. For each turn, one person has to choose one of the foods, and the other will eat the other.\n",
      "Don’t Wipe your Mouth challenge\n",
      "The Don’t Wipe Your Mouth Challenge only needs one person to make it, and it’s pretty simple. You just have to eat messy food without wiping your mouth. This works better with finger food with a lot of sauce — chicken wings or ribs, for example.\n",
      "Candy Challenge\n",
      "This game aims to guess the type (or flavor) of candy you’re eating while blindfolded! Whoever gets the answer right most often wins.\n",
      "Mystery Drink Challenge\n",
      "The mystery drink challenge requires contestants to conceal various drinks with them not knowing what they’re drinking.\n",
      "You can either choose a variety of flavors and see if contestants can guess what they are.\n",
      "Or you can go with a much more entertaining version that involves a yummy drink and then others of varying disgustingness.\n",
      "Healthy vs. Junk Food Challenge\n",
      "Depending on what type(s) of food you like to consume, this challenge could be easy or difficult for you.\n",
      "The healthy vs. junk foods challenge pairs two or more individuals against each other for a given time period where they can either only eat healthy foods or junk foods.\n",
      "Healthy food isn’t necessarily tastier than junk food, but you’re going to feel a whole lot better after eating it than if you’d eaten junk food.\n",
      "Only Using One Color To Cook Challenge\n",
      "This challenge is pretty self-explanatory, but the execution is more difficult than you think.\n",
      "Can you cook up a tasty meal with only one color?\n",
      "What’s in My Mouth?\n",
      "You’ll want to grab a partner for this challenge to make it more exciting!\n",
      "A blindfolded person is given an assortment of food, but sometimes also objects, that are put into their mouths.\n",
      "It’s quite easy to get started as all you really need is a blindfold, and you can easily produce some funny, spontaneous moments on YouTube.\n",
      "Let The Person in Front of you Decide What to Eat\n",
      "You can either use a drive-through or go behind the person in front of you to see what they order and then order the same thing. Who knows? You might end up liking their taste better.\n",
      "Smoothie Challenge\n",
      "Whether you succeed or fail at the smoothie challenge is up to you. If you don’t get a delicious treat, then you may need to run to a trash can.\n",
      "Here, you take some ingredients; half should taste good, while the other half shouldn’t taste too good. You then write down each ingredient on a piece of paper and then mix them together in a bowl or hat.\n",
      "Players then choose ingredients randomly from the bowl to blend into their smoothies.\n",
      "To complete the challenge, you just need to drink the smoothie. Sounds pretty good, right? That is until you start mixing salsa with ice cream.\n",
      "Ye be warned, those with easily upset tummies.\n",
      "Bean Boozled Challenge\n",
      "The Bean Boozled Challenge is a fun YouTube challenge that is probably even more fun for Harry Potter fans. You’ll be challenged to eat different jelly beans based on the flavors of Harry Potter books/films.\n",
      "To complete this challenge, you will need the Bean Boozled jelly bean box, where you will encounter ten tasty beans and ten look-alike beans with strange and unusual flavors.\n",
      "Ice Cream Taste Test\n",
      "With the Ice Cream Taste Challenge, all you need to get a bunch of different flavors of ice cream and then blind-test each one.\n",
      "By guessing the right flavors, you win!\n",
      "Challenge yourself and get someone else to purchase the different flavors, or mix up your own ice cream with unique flavors.\n",
      "Tin Can Challenge\n",
      "The Tin Can Challenge is a different kind of blind-tasting challenge.\n",
      "This is an easy one to set up. For this challenge, just grab some canned food and remove the labels from each one.\n",
      "Now mix everything up, so you don’t know which one is which, and each participant takes turns trying out random cans.\n",
      "Baby Food Challenge\n",
      "Another quick and easy challenge for you is the Baby Food Challenge.\n",
      "If you want to buy baby food, you can go to the store to pick some up or order a mixed pack online.\n",
      "This can be done on your own or with other people.\n",
      "Hungry Hippo Challenge\n",
      "To participate in the Hungry Hippo Challenge, you must eat as much candy as possible in a certain period.\n",
      "You keep putting the candies you can get with your mouth into a bowl or cup, and then at the end, the person who has the most candies in their bowl or cup wins.\n",
      "Brand Name vs. Generic Brand\n",
      "Can you tell the difference between brand-name foods and generic ones? This challenge tests your sense of taste and adds an interesting twist when the generic brand is chosen over the name brand.\n",
      "Whipped Cream Challenge\n",
      "The whipped cream challenge requires you to place a dollop of whipped crea­m on the top of your hand with your arm extended. With your other hand, you smack your arm, causing the whipped cream to fly into the air, and hopefully, you then catch it in your mouth.\n",
      "I say hopefully because it’s not as easy as you may think, and it can be quite funny where it ends up falling. \n",
      "Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bear Challenge\n",
      "While Haribo Gummy Bears are typically sweet and delicious candies, many reviews call out the sugarless gummy bears for causing an upset stomach. Nothing major, but enough to spark a YouTube challenge trend.\n",
      "This challenge involves eating a 5-pound bag of the German confectionery company sugar-free bears.\n",
      "Family-Fun\n",
      "The YouTube challenges listed below are great for the family! Whether you want to do a video with the siblings, the parents, your spouse, or maybe even the kids (if they’re old enough), these challenges are sure to be a bonding experience.\n",
      "Who Wore it Better\n",
      "This is a fun challenge to do with your siblings! Get outfit inspiration from a celebrity or a movie, and you each throw together a similar outfit based on the original inspiration. Then, you let the viewers decide who wore it better!\n",
      "Coin Flip Challenge – Crazy Dares Challenge\n",
      "This can be a really fun way to take on a dare. It works best when you have a group size of 2-5 people so you can rotate the tasks. Decide on a dare between two or more people, for example, “eat a can of cat food.” Each must then decide whether they want to be heads or tails and flip a coin. Whoever loses has to do the challenge.\n",
      "Making my Friend Ugly\n",
      "This challenge is pretty self-explanatory. Do you know when you’re playing Sims and selecting “Randomize” in the character creation? It’s pretty much like that.\n",
      "Just pick out the outfit and makeup to make the other participant look their worst.\n",
      "Mute Challenge\n",

      "On a Friday at Doherty Memorial High School in Worcester, Massachusetts, 14-year-old Harris Wolobah was handed a small coffin-shaped box, emblazoned with a skull and snake, that contains a single spicy tortilla chip called the One Chip Challenge.Paqui, a Hershey company-owned brand that makes the chip, doesn't have a measurement for how spicy its product is or a Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) rating that shows the level of pungency of a pepper.But the chip is made with the Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers, which are rated at about 1.6 million and 1.4 million SHU, respectively. Jalapeno peppers, in comparison, range from 2,500 to 8,000 SHU.The \"challenge\" is simple: Eat the whole chip in one sitting, and see how long you can last without desperately grabbing a glass of milk or water.\n",

      "Health experts have already warned about the potential side effects of participating in the One Chip Challenge: vomiting, stomach pain, difficulty breathing, and even cardiac arrest. But Wolobah, like so many others, most likely either had no clue about the warnings or brushed it off.Plus, countless others have already tried the challenge and shared their experience on YouTube. Pain quickly ensues but the participants seemed to come out of it okay.When Wolobah ate the chip, the sophomore must have had an especially adverse reaction. According to Harris's mother, Lois Wolobah, he fainted and was sent to the nurse's office that day.\"When I went there, he was lying down and I said, 'What was the chip you ate?'\" his mother told WBZ TV. Wolobah showed his mom the Paqui brand One Chip Challenge. His father, Amos, said his son didn't have any pre-existing condition, at least to his knowledge, he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Wolobah died in his home hours later. Autopsy results have not yet been released, and the family and Hershey did not respond to a request for comment. But the Wolobahs are pointing the blame squarely at the One Chip Challenge.Paqui in response said in a statement that it's working with retailers to \"remove the product from shelves.\"It's unclear if the heat had anything to do with Wolobah's death, but the challenge's mere existence points to a uniquely American fascination with spice.At restaurants, sweat-inducing heat is almost expected on the menu. In the aisles of grocery stores, shoppers can choose from a dizzying selection of hot sauces. And in South Carolina, a farm is singlehandedly responsible for developing one of the hottest peppers ever eaten by mankind. The farm recently just topped its own record with a pepper rated at more than 2 million Scoville Heat Units.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The demand has sometimes veered into the realm of morbid curiosity. Online, content creators farm for attention by taking part in extreme food challenges, expecting the pain, while millions watch.Here's how we got here.It all began with an Italian explorerThe very brief summary of the chile peppers' origin starts somewhere in South America around Bolivia and Brazil, according to Stephanie Walker, an extension vegetable specialist at New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute.When humans discovered peppers and their kick — a sensation, not a flavor — thousands of years ago, they immediately latched onto the fruit as a medicinal crop, and through human selection, a variety of chile peppers of different sizes and shapes started to appear, Walker told Business Insider.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the chile pepper's global proliferation began with a familiar name: Christopher Columbus.Columbus was looking for black peppercorns — a highly sought-after fruit at the time — but instead encountered a red plant that had a similar pungency, according to Walker. Hence the reason why we call the red fruit, chile peppers, despite having no relationship to the black peppercorn.Once the Italian explorer took the seed back to the Old World, the fruit took off.\"Many countries, especially Asian countries, African countries, really embraced it and started developing their own particular types of chile based on the flavors, the heat level, and other attributes that they preferred,\" the professor said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "At least since the 20th century, the US has consistently seen a steady increase in chile pepper demand, especially as immigration opened up in the country.Between 1980 and 2020, chile pepper consumption increased more than twofold, from three pounds to seven pounds per person according to a 2021 research paper from the New Mexico State University's Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business.\n",
      " Related stories\n",
      "\"Consumption of peppers is going up in the United States, and it has been steadily for some time,\" Walker said.By 2020, according to the USDA, the chile pepper market was valued at $100 million. \n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "A world recordEd Currie — arguably the godfather of extremely hot chile peppers for his hand in developing the world's hottest chiles — traces his fascination with spice back to his college days in the '80s when his parents had to give him a reality check.\"My parents told me I was going to die of heart disease or cancer, and I had better do something about it if I wanted to keep on living the lifestyle that I was leading,\" Currie told Business Insider. Currie, at that time, was a \"full-blown alcoholic and addict.\"His habits didn't come to a sudden halt, but he did discover his interest in peppers during visits to the school library at absurd hours. In particular, Currie was piqued by the chile peppers' medicinal qualities. Perhaps, he thought, they contained the key to keep him chugging along.\"I found out that the lowest indices of cancer and heart disease were around the equator from the two tropics,\" he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Currie began sending letters all over the world, mostly to embassies, requesting samples of chiles or chile seeds. The internet still had a few years before it truly took off.After a brief stint as a bank trust officer and a move to South Carolina, Currie opened a small booth at a flea market slinging homemade salsa using peppers he grew in his yard. In 2003, Puckerbutt Pepper Company was born. Currie by then also was a recovering addict for several years.\n",
      " Ed Currie holds his Guinness Book of World Records certification for his new Pepper X.\n",
      " Jeffrey Collins/AP\n",
      "It was at his farm in Fort Mills, where Currie developed two of the hottest peppers in the world — at least according to Guinness World Records.In 2013, he set a world record with his Carolina Reaper pepper, which was recorded then with an average of 1.6 million Scoville Heat Units — just about the same pungency as police pepper spray, according to The Associated Press.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In October, he broke his own record again after patiently waiting more than a decade for someone to dethrone his Reaper. The pepper, called Pepper X, measures at about 2.7 million SHU.The South Carolina farmer gave three reasons why he and his team created peppers that are essentially suitable for torture.One, \"because we can,\" he told Business Insider.Two, Currie's interest in the chile pepper's medicinal qualities persists.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "And, three, \"for flavor,\" he says.Currie doesn't enjoy burning himself up more than anyone else, although he's likely developed an extraordinary tolerance over the years testing hot peppers.The challenges that are spawned from his product, including the One Chip Challenge that so happens to be seasoned with the Reaper, might make for effective marketing, but Currie doesn't care to participate.\"I don't do those challenges 'cause they're stupid,\" he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Instead, developing a hotter pepper is part of a business model that would allow him to sell, for example, a hotter sauce with less pepper he says, but also, believe it or not, about creating a better-tasting product.\"The philosophy for me is how can I take something that's already popular and make it taste better,\" he said.Make it hotter, chefFor as long as Roberto Santibañez was based in the US, the chef of almost four decades recalls Americans having a unique affinity to spicy foods.Santibañez, a Mexico City native who opened three restaurants in his hometown, moved to New York City in 1996, where he would later open Fonda in 2009 serving contemporary Mexican food.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "When his family got a taste of his spin on his native cuisine, they were shocked by the levels of heat.In Mexico and in school at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, Santibańez felt that restaurants and chefs cooked with spice but with a bit of caution.\n",
      " Related stories\n",
      "In the US, however, Santibańez has to remember: \"People really go for it.\"\"I think what I've experienced is if you promise people with wordings like, 'This is a spicy sauce,' then people really want it spicy,\" he told Business Insider. \"You can not fail them.\"\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Some Fonda patrons ask for more heat on top of the hot salsas already served at his restaurant, Santibañez said, and he'll oblige by giving them diced habanero, a pepper rated at 150,000 to 350,000 SHU. In his cookbooks, the chef will advise home cooks not to be afraid to add more spice, understanding what his audience expects.Americans' high tolerance for spice at restaurants can also be charted with the explosion of the Nashville Hot Chicken scene.The dish — generally, fried chicken slathered with a cayenne-pepper-based sauce or paste and typically served with pickles and white bread — has been around for several decades, perhaps even as far back as the 1930s, according to NPR.Prince's Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville is often cited as the originator. The lore behind the recipe is said to have involved a woman creating the dish to punish her cheating partner, Thornton Prince, the great-uncle of the restaurant's owner, Andre Prince.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In the past decade, however, the hot chicken appears to have received renewed attention with headlines on how the Nashville Hot Chicken is exploding in popularity.One man responsible for the hot chicken's prominence in southern California is Johnny Ray Zone, a Los Angeles native with a childhood love for spicy food and snacks.\"I was a big fan of Hot Cheetos, even though they're not spicy,\" Zone told Business Insider. \"I ate so many of those I had to get my appendix cut out.\"After his father's untimely death, Zone, who by now had worked his way up from dishwasher to executive chef, took a trip to Nashville and fell in love with the iconic hot chicken dish.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "LA needed this, Zone thought. In 2014, he started Howlin' Rays out of a food truck, serving Nashville hot chicken quarters with side dishes such as braised collard greens and a mac and cheese salad.The simple genius behind Howlin' Rays and its eventual \"viral success,\" as The Los Angeles Times described, was putting the hot chicken in sandwich form — something Nashville did not have at the time, according to Zone.\"Once we did that, then it took off,\" he said.\n",
      " Chef Johnny Ray Zone, left, prepares Nashville Hot Chicken at LA Food Fests 2016.\n",
      " Tara Ziemba/Getty Images\n",
      "But one part of the Nashville Hot Chicken experience Zone made sure to preserve was offering different levels of spice, going from mild all the way up to \"howlin'\" and \"howlin' plus plus,\" which is off-menu.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In Nashville, every hot chicken restaurant offers different levels of spice and might have a unique name for each level, Zone said. And each restaurant had its own take on what their level of \"hot\" was.\"That's part of the lure of hot chicken,\" he said.This doesn't mean that hoards of customers are coming in requesting the top three spice levels available. Zone said that they're actually \"not that popular.\"But when first-time customers do feel adventurous, Zone makes sure to give them a small sample of what to expect.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\"If people hear so much stuff about us, and it's their first time trying it, we don't want their experience to be ruined,\" Zone said. \"And we keep it authentic for how hot it is in Nashville. We don't want to dumb it down just for sales.\"A nuanced heatNovelty chip challenges, extreme peppers, and hot chicken satisfy the appetite of a small base of thrill seekers — while millions of others just watch — but our dishes aren't necessarily getting hotter.In fact, the pendulum could be swinging the other way.Denise Purcell, vice president of content and education of Specialty Food Association, which highlights trends in global, artisanal foods, told Business Insider that more and more food retailers and purveyors are thinking about how to incorporate heat to complement the foods we eat rather than overpowering our experience.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\"The trend seemed to be the hotter, the better — like ghost pepper and whatever the hottest pepper is,\" Purcell said. \"Let's see if people could handle it. And that is giving way a little bit to this more nuanced heat idea, where it's not just all about burning your tongue and seeing what your tolerance is. It's heat that enhances the flavor. It's things like hot honey we see now in a lot of menus and a lot of packaged products.\"The push to incorporate a more nuanced heat is also being commercialized, as fast food companies roll out sweet and spicy products or sauces.Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen intermittently brings back its hot honey sauce and chicken. McDonald's last month released its Sweet & Spicy Jam sauce for a limited time, which incorporates Szechuan peppercorn and cayenne pepper, according to the fast food restaurant.For Zone, the spicy foods he's intimately familiar with are dishes from one of many Thai restaurants that dot Los Angeles and have incorporated a balance of sweet and spicy like larb or yum nua.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\"In all these different Thai classics, the sugar balances out the spice,\" he said. \"And so how long have they been serving that? Hundreds of years.\"\n",

We’re here to refresh your memory.Share full article29VideoCreditCredit...By Madison Malone KircherDec. 20, 2023Algorithms are getting good, alarmingly so, at feeding you content targeted to your weird and wonderful and even secret interests. Still, a lot of interesting stories end up falling outside our digital castle walls. This list is an attempt to rectify that, revisiting the people, trends, feuds and frenzies that took off on social media platforms in 2023 but might not have broken into your personal World Wide Web.Did you see the olive oil executive trying to start beef with another olive oil executive on LinkedIn? How about the woman who gets paid thousands of dollars by pretending to be a video game character? Or the young Texan who is facing prison time after his lavish wedding blew up on TikTok? We’ve got you covered.The InexplicableImageAriana DeBose wows the crowd at the British Academy Film Awards; the snack plate known as Girl Dinner; the lip-sync star Sabrina Bahsoon; Roman Empire soldiers; and the post-makeover Barney.Credit...Clockwise from left, Stuart Wilson/BAFTA, via Getty Images; Alana Laverty; Giorgio Cosulich/Getty Images; Mattel; Sabrina BahsoonHail, Caesar?Find a man, any man, and ask him how often he thinks about the Roman Empire. According to TikTok, the answer is at least once a day. Viral videos on the platform inspired a “Saturday Night Live” sketch in November. “The Roman Empire, Ancient Rome,” rapped the episode’s guest host, Jason Momoa. “Five times a day, it pops into my dome.”Don’t Call It a SnackGirl Dinner was a big summertime TikTok trend. A number of people — mostly young women, as the name implies — showed off nicely arranged plates comprising a bit of this (cheese), a bit of that (bread, maybe) and a few other things (pickle spear, nuts, salami slice). Proponents said the trend freed them from the tyranny of traditional dinner. Detractors claimed it glorified eating disorders.A Yassified BarneyAfter Barney the purple dinosaur got a makeover in February, baffled fans filled the internet with talk of the character’s new teeth, brighter purple skin, larger eyes and perhaps even a bit of rhinoplasty. (Make that dinoplasty. I’ll be here all article.)The Return of Joe CoolThe “Peanuts” dog created by Charles M. Schulz found a new generation of fans this year. In April, the American Red Cross was inundated with young people looking to donate blood in exchange for a limited-edition Snoopy T-shirt. In October, The Atlantic labeled the cartoon beagle “The Hero Gen Z Needs.”A Broadway-Style Rap. What Could Go Wrong?Ariana DeBose’s opening number at the British Academy Film Awards in February quickly became a meme. Was it bizarre? Yes. Could you look away? Absolutely not. Ms. DeBose, a member of the original “Hamilton” cast, brought the earnest enthusiasm of a Broadway star to a rap that included the lines “Angela Bassett did the thing / Viola Davis, my Woman King.” Social media loved it. And hated it.An Underground StarSabrina Bahsoon, a law school graduate in her early twenties, racked up millions of online views this year by filming herself lip-syncing in the London Underground amid unsuspecting commuters. Tube Girl, as she was known, inspired numerous copycats.The EdibleImageMargaritas, the online food critic Keith Lee, a perpetual stew and Grimace enlivened social media in 2023.Credit...Clockwise from top left, Christopher Testani for The New York Times; Amir Hamja/ The New York Times; McDonalds; Jordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated PressGimme Five Margaritas!On the campus of Louisiana State University in May, Cindy Smock, a 65-year-old evangelical preacher, tried to sell students on the benefits of abstinence by listing the sexual acts that women will supposedly perform after drinking certain numbers of margaritas. Shortly after a video of Sister Cindy’s sermon hit social media, her words inspired a banger of a tune (known as “Gimme One Margarita”) that became TikTok’s song of the summer.Mm, Mm, Good?The writer and comedian Annie Rauwerda stirred up a big reaction on the internet — and in her Brooklyn neighborhood — when she cooked a pot of vegan stew for over a month this summer. Her concoction was based on the “perpetual stews” of culinary lore, and Ms. Rauwerda brought it to a playground each week for anyone who wanted a taste. As it bubbled and steamed in the pot, she encouraged people to toss in their own ingredients, so that it never tasted the same way twice.The Milkshake of DeathIn June, McDonald’s added something to its menu: the Grimace Shake, named in honor of the purple bloblike creature who has long been a foil to the chain’s signature clown. The beverage soon gave rise to a TikTok trend: In video after video, creators started out by pretending to give a positive review of the shake — only to end up dead in a pool of purple goo. Did McDonald’s mind? Nope. “This is free advertising,” said Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania.Atlanta Gets Keith Lee’dKeith Lee, a food obsessive with more than 15 million TikTok followers, has posted influential reviews of restaurants in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles. But he might have had his biggest effect during a visit to Atlanta in the fall, when he gave voice to the gripes of local restaurant-goers by dragging establishments that charged extra for butter, syrup and hot sauce. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted Mr. Lee’s power over the city’s dining scene in a story headlined “Move over, Michelin, Atlanta just got Keith Lee’d.”The Technically EdibleImageJustin and Hailey Bieber and their colleagues in 2023 meme-dom: PinkyDoll, pesto and BORGs.Credit...Clockwise from left, Gotham/GC Images; PinkyDoll; Cate Keane; Christopher Simpson for The New York TimesA Viral Campus ConcoctionSocial media helped spread the popularity of a campus drink, BORG, an acronym for “blackout rage gallon.” In viral TikTok videos, student mixologists filled plastic gallon jugs with water, alcohol, sweet flavorings and a hangover remedy, like Pedialyte. “You don’t taste any of the liquor, which is the great part,” one college student said. Officials were less pleased by the trend. In March, the Amherst Fire Department in Amherst, Mass., reported 28 requests for ambulance transports during a BORG-fueled party at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.The Pesto PromptSusi Vidal, a TikTok creator in Arizona, posted a video in September about how to make homemade pesto. “Call me crazy if you want,” she says at the start, “but I’ve never liked store-bought pesto.” With that, Ms. Vidal inspired a wave of TikTok users to repost the opening of her video as the intro to much crazier confessional stories of their own about ghosts, bad dates and stalkers.Krispy MemeIt was an image that launched a thousand Halloween costumes: Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey, at a Krispy Kreme counter. In the photo, the celebrity couple appears to be dressed for wildly different functions, with perhaps neither appropriately attired for ordering and eating fresh doughnuts. Ms. Bieber is wearing a strapless red minidress and red heels; Mr. Bieber is outfitted in gray shorts, yellow Crocs and a pink baseball cap perched atop a gray hood. The picture was meant to promote Ms. Bieber’s cosmetics line — and it had the desired effect on the social media hive mind.Ice Cream So GoodThe TikTok creator PinkyDoll became a social media celebrity in July because of the livestreams and videos in which she played blank-eyed video game characters, the kind who says inane things like “Mmm, ice cream so good,” which became a catchphrase. Though she was the subject of some online mockery, PinkyDoll made thousands of dollars from her online work.The AudibleImageThe year’s main characters on social media included cute puppets, Flyana Boss, a Eurodance parody, anxious pets, the singer Aliyah Bah and an amusingly inept DJ.Credit...Clockwise from top bottom left, Flyana Boss; via Jamie Shannon; Kyle Gordon; Wulf Bradley for The New York Times; DJ Mandy; Macros by MelBig on Social“Hello, Christ? I’m ’bout to sin again.” That’s a line from “You Wish,” a song by the Los Angeles rap duo Flyana Boss that was huge on social media this summer. In the fall, a snippet of the song “Water,” by the South African singer Tyla, swept the internet, thanks, in part, to the TikTok dance challenge that went with it. (In case you had finally gotten that one out of your head, its refrain goes: “Make me sweat/ Make me hotter/ Make me lose my breath / Make me water.”) “Water” was followed by another TikTok earworm, “It Girl,” by Aliyah Bah, whose multilayered fashion sense, known as Aliyahcore, trended online earlier in the year.Cute and CuterSocial media also fueled the rise of a number of novelty songs. A ditty created by pet owners to soothe anxious dog in elevators became an anthem for anxious humans everywhere. Sing it with me: “She’s so brave / She’s well behaved / She is not afraid!” A fiendishly catchy song from the children’s puppet show “Nanalan’” introduced millions of people to Mona and the program’s other super-cute characters. “Who’s that wonderful girl?” the “Nanalan’” song goes. “Could she be any cuter?”Spoofs Become Hits“Planet of the Bass,” a parody of a ’90s Eurodance track, had a moment in August. Some internet users were amused, and others were horrified, by its kooky music video and baffling lyrics (“Women are my favorite guy”). Shout out DJ Crazy Times, also known as Kyle Gordon, a comedian in Brooklyn. In a similar vein, DJ Mandy, a 19-year-old student in California, made ripples this year as the Internet’s most inept disc jockey. Social media users couldn’t resist sharing videos that showed her making awkward mash-ups and beat drops, complete with a nonsensical transition from Flo Rida to Taylor Swift.ImageA line from Beyoncé’s “Energy” was a signal for you to be very, very quiet.Credit...Kevin Mazur/WireImageThe Quiet Game“Look around, everybody on mute,” Beyoncé sang each night of her “Renaissance” tour. That line, from the song “Energy,” gave rise to a social media challenge wherein audiences competed to see which crowd could be the most hushed. If you couldn’t get tickets, the best seat in the house was a TikTok livestream.The NuptialImageTop right, the social media influencer Emily Mariko on her wedding day. Bottom right, Sofia Richie Grainge.Credit...Clockwise from left, Getty Images; Emily Mariko; Jamie McCarthy/Getty ImagesEmily Getting MarriedEmily Mariko burst onto the viral scene in 2021 thanks to her simple recipe for salmon leftovers. In June, her California wedding became the talk of TikTok. People couldn’t get enough of the details, from the brown bridesmaids dresses to Ms. Mariko’s many outfit changes. It is unclear if salmon was served.Sofia, Also Getting MarriedThis “quiet luxury” ceremony was anything but quiet. Social media users could not stop talking about the wedding of Sofia Richie Grainge, the daughter of Lionel Richie, to Elliot Grainge, a music executive. The soft, subtle makeup! The looks! The slicked-back bun! The South of France backdrop! Months after the April event, TikTok creators were still borrowing from Ms. Richie Grainge’s wedding-day style.TikTok’s Wedding FailLunden Stallings and Olivia Bennett built a huge following on TikTok, partly because of their country-club fashion sense. And so their October ceremony was highly anticipated by fans, who dubbed it TikTok’s royal wedding. The excitement, however, was short-lived. Days after the event, old tweets resurfaced in which one of the brides had repeatedly used a racial slur. The couple issued an apology and added an “anti-racist resources” page to their website, but the damage was done.There Goes the GroomJacob LaGrone and Madelaine Brockway, a wealthy young couple from Texas, caused an online stir thanks to their lavish wedding, a five-day affair that included stops at the Versailles, the Paris Opera house and a reception headlined by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. Ms. Brockway posted several wedding videos on TikTok, all of which went viral and caused commenters to ask, Who are these people? The videos were deleted a few days after the ceremony, when surprising facts emerged about the groom. Namely, that he had fired a gun at police officers from Westworth Village and Westover Hills, Texas, who were trying to serve him with an indictment in March. Mr. LaGrone is now facing a potential life sentence.The TheatricalImageA riverboat brawl, Gwyneth Paltrow, olive oil and a beige apartment also caused online stirs.Credit...Clockwise from top left, Julie Bennett/Getty Images; Emma Ganzarain; Angel Garcia/Bloomberg, via Getty Images; Pool photo by Rick BowmerAn Oily FightA niche drama in the world of olive oil startups went online in April. The chief executive and co-founder of Graza logged on to LinkedIn — a site not known as a forum for beefs — to accuse another olive oil company of stealing his idea. The idea being a squeeze bottle.Mascara Fraud?Mikayla Nogueira, a beauty influencer known for her Boston accent, caused a bit of an online ruckus in January after posting an ad for L’Oreal Telescopic Life mascara. In the video, Ms. Nogueira appears to be wearing false eyelashes, rather than the product she was promoting. (Someone fibbed on the internet? For money? Say it ain’t so!)To Catch a Tabi ThiefAlex Dougé, a social media coordinator in New York, met a man named Josh on Tinder and brought him back to her apartment. The next morning she discovered that her Tabi Mary-Janes, a pricey shoe from the brand Margiela, were missing. After Ms. Dougé recapped the saga on TikTok, internet sleuths quickly located the man. It turned out that he had indeed stolen the prize shoes — and given them to his girlfriend! Oh, the drama! Ms. Dougé eventually got her Tabis back, and social media welcomed a new addition to the roster of awful internet men.Riverboat BrawlA brawl on the Alabama riverfront made national news after a video of the incident went viral in August. The fight came about after five white boaters attacked a Black riverboat captain, who had instructed them to dock their pontoon elsewhere. A Black bystander joined the melee on the captain’s behalf, wielding a folding chair as a weapon. In the brawl’s aftermath, the humble folding chair became a symbol of resistance.Viral TrialGwyneth Paltrow on trial for an accident on the slopes of the Deer Valley Resort in Utah was the internet gift that kept on giving. Social media platforms were blanketed with memes about the proceedings in March as jurors heard testimony on who was to blame for the collision — the Oscar-winning actress or the retired optometrist who had sued her for more than $300,000. Online highlights included Ms. Paltrow’s answer to the question of the “losses” she had suffered because of the incident. “Well,” she said, “we lost half a day of skiing.” The jury found her Gwynocent.Apartment MadnessEmma Ganzarain, a resource management employee in Oslo, just wanted to share photos of her redecorated apartment with her TikTok followers. Before she moved in, she explained, her boyfriend had lived there by himself, and she believed that she had brought some order to the place. Outraged commenters did not agree, accusing Ms. Ganzarain of turning a homey apartment into a sad beige nightmare.The SartorialImageKristina Avakyan was a traveling fashion show, red boots had a moment, bed bugs hit the runways in Paris and Law Roach retired (sorta).Credit...Clockwise from left, Kristina Avakyan; Simbarashe Cha for The New York Times; Derek White/Getty Images; Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesThese Boots Were Not Made For WalkingFashion or marketing ploy? Cartoonish red boots were the talk of TikTok for a moment in February. The bloated footwear was designed by MSCHF, a New York collective with a knack for designing clothes and household goods that send the internet into a frenzy.Law Roach (Kinda) RetiresLaw Roach, an award-winning stylist for celebrities including Anne Hathaway and Celine Dion, created some confusion among the more fashion-conscious quarters of social media in March, when he abruptly announced that he was retiring, only to walk days later alongside Naomi Campbell in a runway show. He later clarified that he was retiring only from styling.The Bed Bugs of ParisWhat’s French for schadenfreude? Amid the glam of Paris fashion week, a story crawled into the headlines. Bedbugs! Everywhere! Videos on social media raised the alarm by showing the little creatures scampering through the Paris Métro.Platform as RunwayKristina Avakyan, a New York resident, gained popularity on TikTok for videos in which she modeled eccentric outfits on subway platforms. She faced criticism after an interview with The Cut, in which she said that people in Harlem and Queens don’t understand her fashion sense.ImageThis photo of the pope in a puffer is not real!Endless A.I. PortraitsThroughout the year, A.I. generators spat out an images of people looking like modified, slightly shinier versions of themselves (with, occasionally, an extra finger or two). The A.I. yearbook photo generator was particularly popular on Instagram. But viewers beware! Pope Francis was not papped walking around in a puffy white Balenciaga coat. That was just some fairly convincing A.I. art.The Mostly DelightfulImageA hairbrush singer, Sofia Coppola’s daughter and Britney Spears drove plenty of online engagement.Credit...From left, The Mattison twins; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images; Valerie Macon/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA Hairbrush Microphone MasterpieceThe Mattison twins, a pair of TikTok creators, performed a funny lip-sync cover of Lady A’s “Need You Now,” singing into a hair brush suspended from the ceiling. (This hairbrush mic is one of the comedy duo’s go-to props.) The low-quality video, posted in February, recalled the simpler comedy of the Vine era (2013-2017, R.I.P.).Dances With KnivesAn Instagram video of Britney Spears dancing in her home wielding two large knives grabbed the attention of viewers in September. Some concerned fans reported the video to the police, to Ms. Spears’s chagrin. “So unacceptable for cops to listen to random fans and come in to my home unwarranted,” she wrote on Instagram. “I’ve been bullied in my home for so long now … ITS ENOUGH!” She later added that the knives were props.So UnfairIn perhaps the most perfect nepo baby behavior of all time, Romy Mars, the teenage daughter of the director Sofia Coppola and the singer Thomas Mars, was grounded for (wait for it) trying to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland using her father’s credit card. “I wanted to have dinner with my camp friend.” Ms. Mars said in a TikTok. She added that her parents had rules against her using social media.The StreamableImageSocial media users argued about Kim Cattrall and Victoria Beckham, shown here with her husband, David Beckham.Credit...From left, Craig Blankenhorn/Max; Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesA Woman of the PeopleIn a scene from “Beckham,” the Netflix documentary series about David Beckham, his wife, Victoria Beckham, is seen telling the camera that she grew up “very working class.” At that moment, her husband pokes his head into the room to ask what kind of car her father drove her to school in. The former Spice Girl tries to duck the question before finally answering, “In the ’80s, my dad had a Rolls-Royce.” After the clip went viral, Ms. Beckham embraced it, posting it on her own TikTok account.Feud? What Feud?The “Sex and the City” cast member Kim Cattrall made a brief cameo in season two of the show’s reboot, “And Just Like That …” She was not in the same frame as any of the other members of the famous foursome, and if you blinked you’d have missed her. But, still, there she was. Our Samantha. Her minutes-long appearance inspired so many memes, tweets and TikToks you might have thought she was there all along.The DebatableImageMatilda Djerf started policing knockoffs, Taylor Swift’s fans put Travis Kelce on the map, Alex Wennberg caused a stir on TikTok, Ozempic found the masses and Bud Light inspired a boycott.Credit...Clockwise from bottom left, Sarah Stier/Getty Images; Loulou d'Aki for The New York Times; Steph Chambers/Getty Images; Lee Smith/Reuters; Nick Wass/Associated PressOzempic ManiaWeight loss drugs made their way to the online set this year, with some influencers casting stigma aside and unabashedly proclaiming their Ozempic use.Djerf Dupe DramaMatilda Djerf, a popular Swedish influencer and a founder of the fashion brand Djerf Avenue, irked fans when her team started reporting TikTok videos that mentioned places to purchase dupes — inexpensive copies — of her pricey designs.Rocky Hockey RomanceDrama rippled through a niche literary community — fans of hockey romance novels — when Felicia Wennberg, the wife of the N.H.L. player Alex Wennberg, said that certain book lovers had become “predatory and exploiting” in their comments about her husband.Bud Light BacklashIn April, the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney partnered with Bud Light for a video promoting the brand. The online ad featuring Ms. Mulvaney angered many conservatives, who called for a boycott. As sales of the beer plunged, the musician Kid Rock posted a video that showed him shooting a stack of Bud Light cases. Months later, TMZ posted a video of him drinking the very same beer at a concert.Taylor Made Travis Famous. Right?The football star Travis Kelce was already a household name before he was romantically linked to one of the most famous women on the planet. This fall, as a prank, many women filmed themselves telling men — usually husbands or boyfriends — that Ms. Swift was going to put Mr. Kelce on the map. Based on the videos, it seems like every guy took the bait.Arielle Chapin, Nancy Coleman, Anna Foley, Jessica Grose, Becky Hughes, Natasha Janardan, Joumana Khatib, Ran Lee, Phoebe Lett, Lauren McCarthy, Jordyn Holman, Callie Holtermann, Tanya Sichynsky, Dodai Stewart, Remy Tumin and Lindsey Wiebe contributed reporting.Madison Malone Kircher is a reporter for The Times. She writes about the internet for the Styles desk.

      "Videos are quickly overtaking all other forms of content on social media.\n",
      "They’re dynamic, engaging and drive incredible results. In fact, 87% of marketers report a direct increase in sales through video.\n",
      "It’s no wonder video is becoming a staple in most brands’ marketing strategies. If you’re still not making the most of this medium, you’re missing out big time.\n",
      "In this article, we’ll share top social media video statistics from reputable sources to update you with the latest video marketing trends and highlight the true value video offers.\n",

      "Social media video marketing statistics\n",
      "Anyone who’s scrolled through Facebook, Instagram or Twitter recently knows that videos play a major part in your experience with these social media networks.\n",
      "Video has been a buzzword in marketing for years, and today brands are using it to carve out devoted followings on social media. Did you know users will retain 95% of a message watched on video as opposed to only 10% read in text?\n",
      "For brands and marketers, choosing to ignore video’s massive role would be a big mistake. If you want to truly connect with your audience where they’re spending time, you have to speak their language—video.\n",
      "But just throwing any videos out there won’t cut it. That’s why understanding the latest data and trends is so important for an effective video marketing strategy. It’s about knowing what kinds of videos truly stop the scroll, spark engagement and drive results.\n",
      "Nine out of 10 businesses are using video for marketing in 2024.\n",
      "Short-form video delivers the highest ROI compared to other marketing trends, and will secure more investment in 2024 than any other format.\n",
      "Eighty-one percent of consumers want to see more short-form videos from brands in 2024.\n",
      "For US adults, video’s share of the average daily social media time is plateauing.\n",
      "Sixty-six percent of viewers will watch the entirety of a video if it’s less than 60 seconds long.\n",
      "Users watched an average of 17 hours of online video content per week in 2023, down from 19 hours a week in 2022.\n",
      "Sixty-nine percent of US consumers prefer watching videos on a smartphone, making it the top device for digital video consumption.\n",
      "Eighty-six percent of consumers spend a quarter or more of their time on social media watching videos\n",
      "Eighty-four percent of people said they visited a website after watching a video ad about the brand’s products or services.\n",
      "Seventy-five percent of video marketers have used AI tools to create or edit marketing videos.\n",
      "Video production is the most common service social media marketers outsource.\n",
      "What this means for your social media marketing video strategy\n",
      "Video continues to dominate social media, especially short-form video. Marketers need to double down on snackable videos optimized for mobile. However, since overall video consumption is plateauing, brands need to work harder to create content that stands out. Be consistent, track your performance and experiment to see what resonates with your audience. Also, consider using AI tools and outsourcing video production to speed up content creation time without sacrificing quality.\n",

      "Facebook video statistics\n",
      "Over the past few years, Facebook has expanded its suite of video options. Today, the Watch tab allows users to view and engage with focused video content. Stories offer a chance for brands to connect and interact with their audience.\n",
      "Additionally, Facebook Live allows brands to host live events, give a peak behind the scenes or engage in real time with their audiences. The following statistics highlight opportunities for social media marketers to optimize their Facebook marketing strategy with video.\n",
      "Over 2 billion people stream videos on Facebook each month.\n",
      "Facebook users spend 50% of their time on the app watching videos.\n",
      "Live video currently dominates Facebook, garnering 3x the median interactions compared to carousels, the next most engaging post type.\n",
      "Eighty-six percent of marketers use Facebook for video marketing, making it the second-most popular platform for that purpose.\n",
      "Seventy-one percent of marketers find Facebook to be the most effective video marketing channel, after YouTube.\n",
      "Facebook videos have an average engagement rate of 0.06%, making them the third-most engaging post types on the platform.\n",
      "Mobile-first video ads are 27% more likely to drive brand lift and 23% more likely to drive message association compared to video ads that are not optimized for mobile.\n",
      "Three-hundred million people use Facebook Stories every day.\n",
      "Eighty percent of Facebook Stories that have sound or voice-overs drive better lower funnel results.\n",
      "The vast majority (74%) of Facebook videos are watched without sound.\n",
      "What this means for your Facebook video marketing strategy\n",
      "With Live video winning on the platform, marketers should prioritize real-time, interactive sessions with their audiences. When it comes to paid media, creating mobile-first ads can boost Facebook video metrics. Finally, since a big chunk of users are watching Facebook videos without sound, brands should focus heavily on visual storytelling and use captions and text overlays to make their content more accessible.\n",
      "Instagram video statistics\n",
      "​​Instagram offers a wealth of video marketing opportunities. With formats like Reels, Stories and posts, marketers have a great deal of choice when it comes to sharing Instagram content.\n",
      "However, it can also be overwhelming for those less experienced with the medium. The following social media video stats shed light on where brands should focus their efforts on Instagram for maximum impact.\n",
      "Fifty-three percent of consumers prefer Instagram Reels over TikTok and YouTube Shorts for watching short-form videos.\n",
      "More than half of Instagram users watch stories on a daily basis.\n",
      "Fifty percent of Instagram users have visited a website to buy a product/service after seeing it in Stories.\n",
      "Instagram Reels generate twice as much reach on Instagram compared to other post types.\n",
      "More than half of Instagram users like, share or comment on a reel at least once a week.\n",
      "Reels make up over 50% of the content reshared in direct messages (DMs).\n",
      "Fifty-six percent of industry professionals increased their video activities on Instagram in 2023.\n",
      "Influencers find Instagram Reels to be the most engaging types of social media posts, followed by Instagram static posts then Stories.\n",
      "In 2023, Instagram Reels saw a nearly 50% drop in reach for accounts with 50,000 to 45 million followers, while those with under 500 followers experienced a decrease of over 75%.\n",
      "What this means for your Instagram video marketing strategy\n",
      "With Stories, Live streams, Reels and in-feed videos, Instagram offers a variety of options for social media marketers to consider. However, with so many available video options, the key is not to pigeonhole your brand into using only one. Provide value by using videos across the network to find your ideal audience regardless of the tab they frequent the most.\n",
      "X (Twitter) video statistics\n",
      "If you’ve scrolled through your X (formerly Twitter) feed lately, you know video is integral to the network’s appeal. Whether it’s a glossy brand announcement, a blockbuster movie trailer or a recording of your neighbors’ kid snuggling their cocker spaniel, X users engage with videos more than any other content type. The social media video statistics below offer insights into how brands can jump on the bandwagon and use Twitter for marketing effectively.\n",
      "People watch 2 billion videos on Twitter daily.\n",

      "Videos with minimal copy versus longer copy have a 13% higher recall and overall view time.\n",
      "Twitter videos that don’t require sound to be understood (with closed captions or text overlays) gain 28% more view time and 1.8 times the return on investment.\n",
      "What this means for your Twitter video marketing strategy\n",
      "While not all of your videos should be product-focused, these Twitter video marketing statistics do showcase that users are not opposed to a sales message when it’s delivered through a well-crafted video. Of course, your brand’s specific mix of entertaining, educational and product-centric content will depend largely on your industry’s standards and your audience’s preferences. But, as you define that blend, consider sprinkling in a few videos that highlight your products in a positive way to drive sales, brand awareness and Twitter engagement.\n",
      "YouTube video statistics\n",
      "As the second-largest search engine (behind Google), YouTube is more than just a network where you can watch dog videos after work. YouTube allows brands to showcase their unique value propositions in an engaging way.\n",
      "But because video is the only kind of content supported, it can also be a bit resource-intensive for many marketing teams. These next few statistics lay out some insights to help brands optimize their YouTube marketing efforts.\n",

      "Globally, YouTube Shorts see an average of 70 billion views each day.\n",
      "Forty-seven percent of social media users follow brands on YouTube.\n",
      "88% of marketers plan to increase or maintain their investment in YouTube in 2024.\n",
      "What this means for your YouTube video marketing strategy\n",
      "YouTube is where consumers are going to learn more about your brand—what you stand for, what you do and how you do it. And those users are clamoring for more video content from the brands they follow. This presents a major opportunity for businesses that aren’t already active to jump in. Or for those who have only dipped their fingers to consistently execute and promote their YouTube video ideas.\n",
      "TikTok video statistics\n",
      "TikTok is a relatively younger platform compared to giants like Facebook and YouTube. But its short-form, vertical, sound-on format has thrown brands into a new era of viral video marketing.\n",
      "However, with trends evolving at breakneck speed, marketers need to have a data-driven pulse on what performs on TikTok and how their audience is using the platform. The social media video stats below will help you keep your TikTok marketing competitive.\n",
      "Half of TikTok users bought something after watching TikTok LIVE.\n",

      "Based on video views, TikTok’s average engagement rate stands at 4.07%, which indicates a YoY drop of 20%.\n",
      "Shorter is not always better. TikTok videos that generated the highest number of views in 2023 were over 54 seconds long.\n",
      "What this means for your TikTok video marketing strategy\n",
      "TikTok is not just for dance challenges and crazy viral videos. It’s increasingly becoming Gen Z’s go-to platform for product research, shopping and more. Brands targeting younger audiences, should prioritize TikTok for product promotion—leverage formats like LIVE and dynamic ads, and create engaging content that highlights your products/services without being salesy.\n",
      "Using social media video in your marketing\n",
      "Looking at the social media video statistics above, one thing is clear. Consumers are asking brands for more video presence, and you must give it to them. With so many choices for how to present your brand via video available, you’re sure to find a good fit for you and your audience.\n",
      "An important first step is to develop clear goals for your social media video strategy so that you have benchmarks to measure against as you track your progress.\n",

      "Final Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Enhancements for \"The Ultimate One Chip Challenge: Spicy Trivia Showdown\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorporate Popular Trends**: Given the rise of interactive and experiential content, consider adding a live streaming component where viewers can participate in real-time trivia questions via comments or polls. This can create a more engaging experience and foster community interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Short-Form Content**: Given the preference for short-form videos (81% of consumers want to see more) and that videos under 60 seconds retain 66% of viewers, break the challenge into bite-sized segments. Create teaser clips or highlight reels that capture the best moments, which can be shared on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use of Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers or popular food bloggers who have a strong following in the food challenge niche. Their participation can draw their audience to your content, increasing reach and engagement. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Engaging Visuals and Sound**: Since 74% of Facebook videos are watched without sound, ensure that your content is visually compelling and includes captions or text overlays to communicate vital information without relying on audio. This is crucial for platforms where users may scroll without sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Challenge Variations**: To keep the content fresh and appealing, consider introducing variations of the challenge, such as themed trivia nights (e.g., focusing on international spicy foods one week and sauces the next). This can keep viewers returning for new content.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **User-Generated Content**: Encourage viewers to film their versions of the One Chip Challenge and submit them for a chance to be featured in your videos. This not only increases engagement but also builds a community around your content. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Utilize AI Tools**: Consider using AI tools for video editing and creating dynamic visuals that can enhance storytelling. This can streamline production and help maintain high-quality video output.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Promotional Strategies**: Use engaging thumbnails and compelling titles to attract clicks. Create an enticing call-to-action at the beginning and end of videos, urging viewers to subscribe, share, and comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Create a Series**: Establish \"The Ultimate One Chip Challenge\" as a recurring series rather than a one-off video. This builds anticipation and a loyal viewer base who will follow along with future episodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Engage with Comments**: Actively engage with your audience in the comments section. Responding to comments and questions can foster a sense of community and encourage more viewers to participate in discussions.\n",

From the drop challenge to dumping freezing water on yourself, there have been a lot. Some are more unique or challenging than others. If you haven't already seen it though, there's a social media challenge that involves eating the hottest chip in the world. It's called the Paqui One Chip Challenge.\n",
      "It involves eating a single spicy tortilla chip... yup, that's it, just one single chip. Super easy right?Think again. This might not seem like such a big deal, but trust us, it is! You'll want to think twice before taking on this challenge. If you're looking to take on the One Chip Challenge though, or just want to know more about it, you're in the right place. Today we'll talk to you about everything you need to know about this spicy challenge!What is the One Chip Challenge: The Paqui Chip 2023 The One Chip Challenge is a social media craze started by Paqui, a tortilla chip company. They sell miniature containers, each with only one very spicy chip and the label reading “One Chip Challenge”.While the 2021 One Chip Challenge was a red chip, and the 2022 year was blue, the newest 2023 Paqui chip is green and comes packing with a heat you won't soon forget! The challenge is to eat the single hot tortilla chip and see how long you can last before eating or drinking anything else.(Note: Paqui makes a limited amount of chips for these challenges. Once they are sold out, you're out of luck. So don't wait to long to get one. The 2022 chip is out of stock, but you can currently sill get the 2023)The Paqui website tests people's will by having them try to wait at least an entire hour after eating one of their chips before consuming anything to relieve the heat. If you manage to do so, you are considered “invincible”. While those who give in and eat or drink a minute after consuming the chip are seen as being “powerless”. Buy The 2023 One ChipParticipants in this challenge then post their reactions accordingly on social media platforms such as TikTok or Facebook. Paqui even goes as far as to share your social media challenge post right on their website!How Hot is The Paqui Chip: The Scoville Units of the One Chip ChallengeWith the challenge being so simple... just eating a simple chip, it begs the question... is the one chip challenge actually hot and if so how hot is it? According to Paqui, the chip hasn't been measured on the Scoville scale, which is what you typically use to gauge how hot a spicy pepper is. So the Paqui Chip Challenge doesn't have an official Scoville rating technically. Now with that being said, we do know what peppers are in the 2023 one chip challenge. This year's latest edition is made with the famous Carolina Reaper Pepper and the Naga Viper Pepper both of which are some of the hottest peppers in the world.The 2022 edition used Carolina Reaper peppers and the Scorpion Pepper. \n",
      "If you're a chili head or someone that enjoys spicy food, you're probably familiar with these peppers as they are among the hottest peppers out there. For those of you who are not chili enthusiasts and are just interested in how hot this chip could actually be... just know that those peppers are extremely hot. \n",
      "To get an idea, you can simply look at the Scoville rating of the two peppers. Carolina Reaper Peppers are around 1.7 million Scoville Units and the Naga Viper Pepper is around 1.4 million Scoville Units. In comparison, a Jalapeno pepper falls in the range of 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville Units. So as you can see, these peppers are significantly hotter! So if you're looking to do the One Chip Challenge, be prepared for some serious heat!How Long Do the Effect of the Paqui Chip Challenge LastNow that we've talked about how hot the chip actually is... let's move on to how long the effects of this chip will last. The answer to this question is... it depends on the person. Heat affects people differently, so while it may last only a few minutes for some, it could be painful for others for over an hour. Some people report feeling the effects of the Paqui Chip Challenge for up to an hour or more while others report only feeling it for a few minutes. It really varies from person to person and how sensitive they are to spicy foods. If you've ever had a really spicy dish before, you know that the heat can last for a while and linger on your tongue. The same goes for the One Chip Challenge, the heat will linger but eventually dissipate. \n",
      "With that being said, the challenge has four levels to grade people. Those who last a minute are listed as powerless. 10 minutes are powerful, 30 minutes are supercharged, and if you can stand an hour, you're labeled as INVINCIBLE. What are the RulesNow let's move on to the rules. The rules of this challenge are pretty simple. All you have to do is eat the entire chip and then wait as long as possible before drinking or eating anything else.Once you've waited as long as you can handle, you can post your reaction on social media with #onechipchallenge and mention @paquichips. Tiktok Paqui Chip Challenge Facebook Paqui Chip Challenge That's all there is to it! Pretty simple right?If you want a good laugh, we highly suggest watching some of the videos that people have posted!Commonly Asked Questions About the 2023 Paqui Chip ChallengeNow that we've gone over the background information of the Paqui Chip Challenge and what it entails, let's move on to some commonly asked questions. Where can I purchase the 2023 One Chip Challenge? Paqui makes a limited number of chips. Once they are sold out, you won't be able to purchase the chip anymore. The 2021 and 2022 one chip challenges are no longer available. However, you can snag the 2023 one chip challenge chip on our website while supplies lasts!Is the 2023 Chip the Same as Their Other Chips? Paqui has been doing the one chip challenge since 2016. And each year it has been different. How Long Do The Effect Last?The effects of the Paqui Chip Challenge will last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more. It all depends on the person and how sensitive they are to spice. What is the Purpose of The Challenge?The purpose of the challenge is to see how long you can last before drinking or eating anything else. How Painful is the One Chip Challenge?The One Chip Challenge can be very painful for some people. The chip is extremely spicy and the heat will linger. The chip uses the Carolina Reaper and the Scorpion Peppers. Which are some of the hottest peppers in the world. I Can't Handle Spice, Can I Still Do the Challenge?We definitely don't recommend it if you can't handle spicy. If a Jalapeno Pepper tends to be too hot for you, stay clear away from this challenge. The Paqui Chip Challenge is not for everyone.Is the One Chip Challenge Real?Yes, the One Chip Challenge is a real challenge. It was created by Paqui Chips and people have been doing it since 2016. Can the Paqui Chip Kill You?The Paqui Chip contains a lot of capsaicin. Capsaicin in concentrations can cause seizures and heart attacks. It's extremely rare for this to happen to the average person. It's more likely to cause someone some pain or burning along with possible intestinal discomfort. The company also states the following:“Our #OneChipChallenge includes a safety disclaimer that it should not be ingested by individuals who are sensitive to spicy foods, allergic to peppers, nightshades, or capsaicin, or who are minors, pregnant or have medical conditions.\"What are the Ingredients of The Paqui ChipThe 2023 One Chip Challenge chips contains Blue Corn, Sunflower and/or Safflower Oil, Carolina Reaper Pepper, Naga Viper Pepper, and Sea Salt.Do You Think You Could Handle The One Chip Challenge?Heck Yes!Not A ChanceThe Paqui Chip ChallengeIf you guys are brave enough to join the others who have taken on the Paqui Chip Challenge, be prepared! Using some of the hottest chili peppers in the world, this chip is no joke. If you guys decide to try out this unique and wild challenge, make sure not to touch your face after touching the chip, and don't try to drink water, drink milk instead. \n",

For heat fanatics looking to prove themselves, there are plenty of food challenges around the world designed for the sole purpose of testing diners’ pain thresholds. From dive bars to food festivals, here are 11 spicy food challenges that make competitors feel the heat.1. Chili Pepper Festival’s Chili-Eating Contest // Hunan, ChinaAt this annual festival in China, guests have the chance to take part in a serious chili-eating contest. To participate, competitors must binge a plate of Tabasco chilies—which come in at between 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville heat units (SHU)—while wading in a pool of floating peppers. At the 2018 competition, which was held in China's Hunan province, Tang Shuaihui won a 24-karat gold coin for consuming 50 peppers in roughly a minute. The previous year's winner had eaten just 15 chili peppers.2. Jitlada’s Spicy Dynamite Challenge // Los Angeles, CaliforniaJitlada in Los Angeles, California, is famous for its mouth-scorching Thai food, but if the regular menu isn’t hot enough for customers, they can accept the restaurant’s Spicy Dynamite Challenge. This stir-fry dish consists of a protein with bell peppers, green beans, and Thai basil with a special mixture of fresh and dried Thai chilies to bring the heat. The challenge is only available to diners 18 and older, and the description on the menu warns participants to eat at their own risk. To complete the challenge, diners have to clean their plate, down to the tiniest pepper scrap.3. Heatwave Hot Sauce Expo’s Extreme Jerky Eating Competition // Ontario, CanadaIn 2019 and 2020, Ontario was home to Canada’s Heatwave Hot Sauce Expo, which held a hot wing-eating contest, a pepper-eating contest, and a chili cook-off. But the most unique challenge at the event may have been the extreme jerky-eating competition, where the contestant who could stomach the most super-spicy dried beef was crowned the festival’s “jerky barbarian.”4. Brick Lane House’s P'hall Challenge // New York City, New YorkBrick Lane House in New York City claims to serve some of the hottest curry on Earth. Their British-Indian p’haal curry is made from 10 to 12 ground chili peppers, including the infamous Carolina Reaper, which measures in at over 2 million SHU. It’s so spicy that the chef needs to wear a gas mask to prepare it. Guests who successfully finish the dish receive a certificate of completion, a free beer, and a picture in the P’haal of Fame.5. Smokin’ Ed’s Pepper-Eating Challenge // Fort Mill, South CarolinaIn 2019, heat-seekers headed to Fort Mill, South Carolina, to take part in a Giant Carolina Reaper-eating contest organized by the Puckerbutt Pepper Company, which is owned by the pepper’s inventor, “Smokin’ Ed” Currie. This Reaper variant measures in at 2.6 million SHU, and the winner and the runner-up of the inaugural competition each took a home check for $1000 for downing them. The excruciating event was featured in the 2020 Netflix series We Are the Champions.6. Bushido’s Seppuku Challenge // Charleston, South CarolinaThe spicy tuna hand rolls at this Japanese restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, are not for the faint of heart. To complete Bushido’s Seppuku Challenge, customers must eat 10 spicy tuna rolls in ascending order from least spicy to spiciest. Winners will receive a Bushido headband, which they can wear to receive a free appetizer any time they visit the restaurant.7. Chunky’s 4 Horsemen Challenge // San Antonio, TexasThe four horsemen of this spicy burger challenge are four peppers of varying heat levels. Guests who accept the challenge will be served a patty topped with jalapeños, serranos, habanero sauce, and ghost peppers. After consuming the whole burger within 25 minutes (and enduring a five-minute waiting period afterward), champions get their picture added to the Wall of Flame.8. Philippine Chili Festival’s Labuyo 100 Rites // Manila, PhilippinesTo join the exclusive Labuyo 100 club, guests at the Philippine Chili Festival must devour 100 pieces of the labuyo chili pepper, an important ingredient in Philippine cuisine that packs 80,000 to 100,000 SHU. Following that initiation, members are expected to maintain their heat tolerance by taking part in the annual Labuyo 100 Rites each year along with the new inductees in order to renew their membership.9. Salvador Molly’s Great Balls of Fire // Portland, OregonThe Great Balls of Fire at Salvador Molly’s are even hotter than they look. The cheesy fritters are packers with habanero peppers and served with a special “Sunshine & Pain” hot sauce. If diners can finish a plate of five in one sitting, their picture will be shared on Facebook and added to the restaurant’s Wall of Flame.10. Bath Chili Festival’s Pepper-Eating Contest // Bath, UKThe Clifton Chili Club organized this pepper-eating contest at the annual Bath Chili Festival in Southwest England in 2015, which started with a mild jalapeño and got progressively hotter from there. Peppers featured in the challenge included the Naga king chili, the yellow 7 Pot habanero, and the Carolina Reaper. In the past, contestants who made it past level 17 have won a cash prize and various chili pepper products (but they're probably happiest about the free milk afterward). The Clifton Chili Club holds similar competitions at festivals across the UK every year.11. Jake Melnick’s Corner Tap’s XXX Wings // Chicago, IllinoisCoated in a sauce made from Trinidad scorpion peppers, the XXX Wings at Jake Melnick’s Corner Tap may be the hottest wings in Chicago. They’re served with a fireman’s helmet and a waiver, and you can even request a cooling plate of milk and ice cream if you need some quick relief. Diners who conquer an order get their pictures displayed on Jake’s Wall of Flame.Home / FOODABOUTCONTACT USNEWSLETTERSPRIVACY POLICYCOOKIE POLICYTERMS OF SERVICEACCESSIBILITY STATEMENTSITEMAPA-Z IndexCookie Preferences© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved\n",

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure \"The Ultimate One Chip Challenge: Spicy Trivia Showdown\" stands out in the crowded hot sauce and challenge video landscape, here are several strategies and suggestions to make the video unique:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Interactive Live Trivia**: Unlike typical challenge videos, incorporate an interactive live trivia component where viewers can participate in real-time by answering trivia questions via chat. This could enhance engagement and create a sense of community.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diverse Challenge Formats**: Instead of a basic one-chip challenge, consider variations such as team competitions, where participants answer trivia questions to earn chips or milk as rewards. This adds a strategic element to the challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incorporate Educational Content**: Include brief, informative segments about the peppers used in the chip, their origins, and the science behind spicy food. This educates viewers and distinguishes the video from mere consumption challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Unique Participant Profiles**: Introduce diverse participants with unique backgrounds, such as those who are known for their love of spicy food versus those who typically avoid it. This contrast can create entertaining dynamics and relatable moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Themed Trivia**: Create trivia questions that are themed around pop culture, the history of spicy foods, or even facts about the participants. This adds layers of interest beyond just the heat factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Post-Challenge Reactions**: After the challenge, include a segment where participants share their experiences, reactions, and any funny or unexpected moments. This personal touch can resonate more with viewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **High-Quality Production**: Invest in high-quality video production with dynamic camera angles and editing. Use slow-motion effects for dramatic moments, like the first bite of the chip, to heighten viewer anticipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Incorporate User-Generated Content**: Encourage viewers to submit their trivia questions or challenge ideas, which can be featured in future videos. This not only engages the audience but also fosters a sense of ownership and community.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Engaging Thumbnails and Titles**: Use eye-catching thumbnails and creative titles that highlight both the challenge and trivia aspects. This can help draw in viewers who might be searching for either type of content.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Follow-Up Content**: Create follow-up videos based on viewer reactions, questions, or even a \"What Happened After the Challenge?\" segment, which can deepen viewer connection and encourage subscription for more content.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these suggestions, \"The Ultimate One Chip Challenge: Spicy Trivia Showdown\" can effectively differentiate itself from existing content, enhance viewer engagement, and maximize its viral potential in the hot sauce niche.\u001b[0m\n",

What HQ Trivia figured out is that realtime video isn't the killer app, compelling realtime content is.Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinHQ Trivia is all the rage right now. It's an app that is part live game show and part Trivia Crack App (remember that?). And it's important for marketers to understand because it dramatically changes the way users think about apps and at the same time inspires brands by reminding them that an exciting new technology - in this case live-streaming video - is useless until there's something compelling to do with it.\n",
      "Here's what it looks like:\n",
      "Screenshots from the HQ Trivia App.\n",
      "HQ Trivia\n",
      "What Is HQ Trivia?\n",
      "My 20 year old daughter told me about it (big surprise). She said, \"Dad you have to play HQ Trivia, it's soooo much fun.\" The last thing I need is another app in my life, but she was pretty emphatic so I tried it.\n",
      "I'm hooked.\n",
      "The concept is simple: at 3:00 pm and 9:00 pm EST every day there is a live trivia contest with a live host asking questions and receiving interactive/realtime answers from what was over 300,000 people last time I played. He asks twelve questions, starting with easy ones, ending with super hard ones. And if you get them all correct you share the cash prize with whomever else also got them all correct.\n",
      "When I played the cash prize was $1500. Not bad.\n",
      "Why Is HQ Trivia A Big Deal?\n",
      "Any new brand - in this case, an app - that can get a quarter million people to not only change their behavior, but drop everything at 3:00 pm and do something is a force worth our analyzation.\n",
      "Like we've seen many other activities democratized over the last ten years - e.g. we can all make movies now, we can all record multi-track songs now, we can all get our photography printed out on canvas as a simulated oil painting now, etc. - the HQ Trivia app allows everyone to do something formerly reserved for the connected or the lucky: participate in a game show for cash prizes.\n",
      "I remember when a local guy made it onto Wheel Of Fortune, he became an instant celebrity around town. Now anyone can compete for cash prizes right from their phone.\n",
      "And beyond that, this app successfully convinced people that an app where you have no control over when you play was worthwhile. Imagine that.\n",
      "But it's an even bigger deal for marketers.\n",
      "Riddle Me This.\n",
      "I've read in other places that the app is currently not making any money. Of course, there are plans to make money and the strategy, for now anyway, is apparently to build the audience and then go sell access to it. Not crazy.\n",
      "But apparently the founders of this app - Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll of Intermedia Labs and previous founders of Vine - do not want to sell typical display advertising. They say they don't want to ruin the experience with advertising and instead want the advertising to enhance the experience.\n",
      "In other words, they want you - you marketers out there - to come up with ways to sponsor this powerful little punch with creative advertising ideas that will add to the experience.\n",
      "Think of the possibilities. The variables to play with are: the questions that are asked, the host, what the host says, the backdrop graphics, the countdown time (there's a waiting period on the app between the text notification that a game is beginning and the time the game actually starts), the winner page at the end of each game, and that's just off the top of my head.\n",
      "Now, assuming you've got a potent brand idea, what would your brand do in any or all of those game variables? What questions could be asked about your brand or about your brand's category? What jokes could you plant for the host to tell that benefit your brand somehow? What would your brand do while people are waiting for the game to start to help them with their nerves, to pass the time more quickly, or to provide the countdown in a unique branded way?\n",
      "I can't think of a more fun assignment. But there's more.\n",
      "What Else Could We Do With A Realtime App Like HQ Trivia?\n",
      "Realtime live-streaming video, as a technology, has been around for a while. Facebook has been trying to push people into doing it for over a year now. But HQ Trivia is different.\n",
      " What HQ Trivia figured out is that realtime video isn't the killer app, compelling realtime content is.\n",
      "Just like the democratization of film-making doesn't suddenly make any of us a Spielberg, the democratization of live streaming video doesn't make any of us (or our brands) suddenly interesting. HQ Trivia came up with a great concept first and it happened to utilize live streaming video.\n",
      "What other ideas can you come up with that would take advantage a live experiences via an app?\n",
      "Again, let's start with my favorite question for brands: what would your brand do if it had access to live streaming video? Really think about this question. Literally ask your brand. Out loud. If nothing comes to mind, you may want to shore up your brand idea.\n",
      "Or maybe you just need some inspiration. Here are some thought starters:\n",
      "Hamilton, the broadway show, could schedule a live stream of a portion of a performance. Or maybe the whole thing one night. Maybe it's guaranteed for five minutes, but if during that time 1,000,000 log in to watch, they will keep it going for the whole show.\n",
      "Titleist has access to all kinds of PGA Tour pros. One of them is Jordan Spieth. How about every Saturday morning at 7:00 Jordan does a live tip for golfers. A little inspiration from the \"#1 Ball In Golf\" before you head out to the course. Jordan could ask people to vote for which tip they want - e.g. chipping, putting or tee shots. Maybe even take typed in questions from the audience.\n",
      "Spotify could steal a page from MTV \"Unplugged\" and have a 15 minute live set from a surprise artist every Sunday at 10:00 am. The artist is allowed only a stool, a mic, and a guitar. Then people \"attending\" virtually through the app can vote on three songs out of a list of ten for the artist to play.\n",
      "Stephen King, while writing his next book, could stage weekly check-ins with fans where his story is at a crossroads and he wants the fans to decide where it goes next. He explains the story so far and then gives 4-5 different possible scenarios and lets fans decide. Which fans who participated wouldn't buy that book when it comes out? Plus, people will become familiar and intrigued with the storyline based on King's prompts.\n",
      "It could go on and on, of course. And I hope it does (I am praying that a client comes to me with this assignment).\n",
      "HQ Trivia has inspired me. It has given live video-streaming an extremely compelling application that has hundreds of thousands of people clamoring to participate.\n",
      "So what are you going to do with it?\n",
      "That's the real question.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Will BurnsEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\n",

      "Hot Sauce Market Trends: How Gen Z is Redefining Hot Sauce Culture\n",
      "Hot sauce can be a polarizing topic: some can’t eat it while others can’t go without it – to the point where they even bring it to restaurants. Among hot sauce enthusiasts, this topping is more than a condiment, it’s a culture. \n",
      "As Americans make homemade hot sauce, test the limits of their taste buds, and try artisanal hot sauce, one generation seems to be fueling this trend: Gen Z. In a survey of over 1,000 Americans about consumer hot sauce habits and preferences, we found Gen Z really stands out.  While 34% of Americans consider themselves “hot sauce connoisseurs,” over half (51%) of Gen Zers classify themselves as one. \n",
      "Five Reasons People Eat Hot Sauce \n",
      "Ninety-three percent of Americans eat hot sauce, but their tolerance varies. A bold 9% say they can eat anything as hot as possible, and 31% can handle hot flavors. Meanwhile, 33% say their limit is medium, while 20% can handle mild and nothing more. \n",
      "One generation is leading the charge when it comes to hot sauce: Gen Z. While 21% of Americans have been willing to sign a waiver to eat something with hot sauce, 35% of Gen Z have done the same. Their presence on social media could be a key driver. Over one in three (34%) Zoomers have tried a social media-inspired hot sauce challenge. \n",
      "One respondent called hot sauce her “entire life” saying: \n",
      "“I would eat hot sauce any day. It is a great conversation starter. I also really like Hot Ones and made my own Hot Ones challenge.”\n",
      "Over half (51%) of Americans use hot sauce more than once a week. People are drawn to hot sauce for five common reasons: \n",
      "Enjoy the taste\n",
      "Feel it adds depth to the dish\n",
      "Enjoy the sensation of heat\n",
      "Grew up eating hot or spicy foods\n",
      "Like to customize the heat level of their meals \n",
      "However, all this hot sauce comes with a physical price. Over two in three (68%) say it causes them to have a runny nose, and some end up sweating, crying, or even dealing with some digestive issues. But some Americans are hoping for that physical reaction when eating hot sauce. Nearly one in four – 23% – say they eat it just to clear their sinuses. \n",
      "“Swicy” Food and Drink Trend\n",
      "While sweet and spicy food isn’t a new concept, the word “swicy” is a new trendy term being used in marketing. Searches for the word on Google have increased 1,700% from March 2023 to March 2024 (the latest data available from Google at the time of this report), and three in four Americans say they would be willing to try swicy food or drinks. \n",
      "Although a bold 37% of Americans would try a taste of the hottest pepper in the world, younger generations have a greater desire to test their taste buds. Sixty percent of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials said they’d try a bite.\n",
      "Go-To Hot Sauces\n",
      "People are passionate about the hot sauces that they use. About one in four Millennials and Gen Z bring their own hot sauce to restaurants rather than run the risk of not having it for their meal. \n",
      "When it comes to buying hot sauce, 51% consider Scoville units before making a purchase. Scoville units are the measurement of how hot a pepper is rated. Over three in five (62%) are more likely to buy something if it’s advertised as hot or spicy. \n",
      "People mainly buy hot sauce from the grocery store, but 14% get it at local farmers markets. While the majority of Americans stick with traditional hot sauce brands, over one in 10 (12%) like to have artisanal hot sauces. Overall, the go-to hot sauce brands people prefer are: \n",
      "TABASCO® \n",
      "Frank’s RedHot®\n",
      "Cholula®\n",
      "Louisiana Hot Sauce\n",
      "Texas Pete® \n",
      "The majority of Americans prefer to douse hot sauce on tacos, chicken wings, or burritos. Around the U.S. though, certain regions put it on different foods. Those living in the South are more partial to putting hot sauce on seafood or soups and stews. In the Northeast, mac and cheese, fried rice, and hamburgers are more commonly eaten with hot sauce. Out West, people try hot sauce with their burritos and eggs. \n",
      "While one in 10 Americans who are over 21 prefer to sip something alcoholic while eating something with hot sauce, the majority prefer to drink something non-alcoholic. Most drink water followed by soda or milk. \n",
      "Top 5 Favorite Cuisines Known for Their Spice\n",
      "Hot sauce culture drives a desire for spice that extends outside of sauce. Americans enjoy a variety of spicy foods from around the world with three in four consumers specifically enjoying cuisines known for their spice. The top cuisines Americans enjoy include Mexican, Chinese/Szechuan, Spanish, Thai and Indian. \n",
      "The places where people live and grow up can strongly influence their hot sauce habits. In fact, 19% of those living in the South and 18% of those in the West say they eat hot sauce with their food because they live in a place with a lot of hot and spicy food.\n",
      "While one in three attribute their high tolerance for hot sauce to their hometowns or places they currently live, 27% credit cultural or social influences for their tolerance. More than half of Asian and Hispanic survey respondents say cultural or social influences have made eating hot sauce easier. \n",
      "One respondent shared his grandmother was Sicilian and that she loved eating hot sauce, so he does too. Another respondent had this to say:\n",
      "“It pairs really well with soda, in my opinion, and it is a part of a lot of my culture’s traditional foods. It’s just really delicious.” \n",
      "Nearly one in 10 (9%) prefer to make hot sauce themselves. Slightly more Hispanic and Asian respondents shared they make homemade hot sauce than the average American. \n",
      "Reasons People Don’t Eat Hot Sauce\n",
      "Hot sauce isn’t for everyone. There are five main reasons people don’t eat hot sauce:\n",
      "Don’t like spicy food\n",
      "Don’t like the burning feeling\n",
      "Digestive sensitivities \n",
      "Low spice tolerance\n",
      "Didn’t grow up eating hot/spicy food. \n",
      "While most Americans still choose hot sauce as their number one condiment, the other top condiment is ketchup. Among all the generations, baby boomers were the only ones to choose ketchup as their top condiment over hot sauce. More women than men also prefer ketchup to hot sauce.\n",
      "According to NCSolutions purchase data, in the first three months of 2024, mayonnaise was the top condiment purchased by consumers. Hot sauce/chili condiments were the second most popular purchase followed by ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce. Interestingly, the end of the year appears to be a more popular time for hot sauce purchases. In 2023, the biggest months for buying hot sauce were December, October, and November.\n",
      "At the end of the day, everyone needs a little spice in their life. At least, that’s what one survey respondent said when we asked them why they like hot sauce. Whether you prefer to spice up your life by eating something with hot sauce or maybe just eating something new, we hope you continually find new flavorful food and drinks.\n",
      "About the Consumer Sentiment Survey\n",
      "The consumer sentiment survey of 1,114 Americans was commissioned by NCSolutions in April and May 2024 and was made up of U.S. adults ages 18+, who were asked about their eating habits and preferences. Results were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, region, ethnicity, marital status, education level, and household income.\n",
      "About the NCS Purchase Data\n",
      "NCS provides purchase insights to brands to help them optimize, measure, and enable sales-based outcomes.NCS’s representative and balanced consumer CPG purchase data set consists of the industry’s preeminent and comprehensive sources. It is inclusive of actual purchase data (transaction information) from big-box retailers, supermarkets, drug stores, convenience stores and other retail channels through which American households buy CPG products spanning 340+ grocery categories. The NCSolutions Purchase Data was analyzed in May 2024.\n",
