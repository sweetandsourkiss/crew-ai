In a recent Tech Check program, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI’s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn’t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits. READ ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss  and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4 As we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it’s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. In the latest round of AI developments, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion, by December. This release is going to be in the form of a phased rollout, where it will gradually release the model to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT. The upcoming frontier model release is quite crucial, considering that the company has recently raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation. Moreover, investors anticipate more advanced models to maintain its leadership in the tech industry. Rival Anthropic comes bearing their own set of breaking news. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic’s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide “mathematically precise and reproducible answers” by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations. Story Continues “Think of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data — cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result”. Despite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI’s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly “hallucinating”. OpenAI may deem it to have near “human level robustness and accuracy”, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings. Such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings…Nobody wants a misdiagnosis” and that “There should be a higher bar.” With that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Innovative Agentforce Platform Drives Positive Outlook, Morgan Stanley Sets Price Target at $330 A woman using a tablet to navigate the cloud-based bill payment technology. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is an American cloud-based software company engaged in the design and development of cloud-based enterprise software. Their offerings include CRM solutions that incorporate advanced artificial intelligence features. Its recent innovation in AI technology is Agentforce, an AI development platform that allows organizations to create, customize, and deploy intelligent agents. On October 25, Analyst Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock and kept the price target at $330. The reaffirmation comes from several factors that emphasize the company’s potential for revenue growth and cost efficiency. Moreover, the company’s Agentforce plays a key role in its promising outlook and is expected to deliver substantial returns on investment as well as positively impact revenue. As per Weiss, the company’s shares are currently undervalued, implying that the market hasn’t realized its full potential yet. The anticipated wider adoption of Agentforce is further expected to enhance Service Cloud contracts significantly. Overall CRM ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 117 UBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries. Story Continues “We see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,” said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note. The firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by “positive, long-term trends,” according to Issel. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category. According to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20–25. In the second quarter, Salesforce’s revenue rose 8% year over year while gross profits jumped 10%. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is also on investors’ radar because of its acquisitions. The company recently agreed to acquire AI voice agent firm Tenyx. This acquisition follows Salesforce’s strategic partnership with Workday to develop an AI-powered assistant for employees. The company has also agreed to buy SaaS data protection startup Own for $1.9 billion in cash. Wall Street expects $11.12 per share in profits for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) next year, representing a 10% year-over-year increase. For the current financial year, profits are expected to grow by 23%, with estimates trending upwards. Based on these forecasts, Salesforce trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22, which is attractive given the AI-related growth catalysts. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “In a tough backdrop for software companies, shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) cratered after the company reported quarterly results that surprised to the downside due to a tougher spending environment. The company reported revenue growth that missed on expectations, while also lowering its outlook for revenue growth, due to a more measured buying environment from its customers. Salesforce experienced elongated sales cycles, deal compression and elevated budget scrutiny, which pushed some deals to following quarters. Taking a step back, the company’s evolving AI story should not be overlooked as it is integrated across the company’s sprawling suite of cloud and digital assets.” Overall, CRM ranks 8th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In a recent Tech Check program, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI’s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn’t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits. READ ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss  and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4 As we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it’s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. In the latest round of AI developments, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion, by December. This release is going to be in the form of a phased rollout, where it will gradually release the model to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT. The upcoming frontier model release is quite crucial, considering that the company has recently raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation. Moreover, investors anticipate more advanced models to maintain its leadership in the tech industry. Rival Anthropic comes bearing their own set of breaking news. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic’s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide “mathematically precise and reproducible answers” by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations. Story Continues “Think of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data — cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result”. Despite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI’s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly “hallucinating”. OpenAI may deem it to have near “human level robustness and accuracy”, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings. Such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings…Nobody wants a misdiagnosis” and that “There should be a higher bar.” With that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Innovative Agentforce Platform Drives Positive Outlook, Morgan Stanley Sets Price Target at $330 A woman using a tablet to navigate the cloud-based bill payment technology. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is an American cloud-based software company engaged in the design and development of cloud-based enterprise software. Their offerings include CRM solutions that incorporate advanced artificial intelligence features. Its recent innovation in AI technology is Agentforce, an AI development platform that allows organizations to create, customize, and deploy intelligent agents. On October 25, Analyst Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock and kept the price target at $330. The reaffirmation comes from several factors that emphasize the company’s potential for revenue growth and cost efficiency. Moreover, the company’s Agentforce plays a key role in its promising outlook and is expected to deliver substantial returns on investment as well as positively impact revenue. As per Weiss, the company’s shares are currently undervalued, implying that the market hasn’t realized its full potential yet. The anticipated wider adoption of Agentforce is further expected to enhance Service Cloud contracts significantly. Overall CRM ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 117 UBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries. Story Continues “We see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,” said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note. The firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by “positive, long-term trends,” according to Issel. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category. According to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20–25. In the second quarter, Salesforce’s revenue rose 8% year over year while gross profits jumped 10%. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is also on investors’ radar because of its acquisitions. The company recently agreed to acquire AI voice agent firm Tenyx. This acquisition follows Salesforce’s strategic partnership with Workday to develop an AI-powered assistant for employees. The company has also agreed to buy SaaS data protection startup Own for $1.9 billion in cash. Wall Street expects $11.12 per share in profits for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) next year, representing a 10% year-over-year increase. For the current financial year, profits are expected to grow by 23%, with estimates trending upwards. Based on these forecasts, Salesforce trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22, which is attractive given the AI-related growth catalysts. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “In a tough backdrop for software companies, shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) cratered after the company reported quarterly results that surprised to the downside due to a tougher spending environment. The company reported revenue growth that missed on expectations, while also lowering its outlook for revenue growth, due to a more measured buying environment from its customers. Salesforce experienced elongated sales cycles, deal compression and elevated budget scrutiny, which pushed some deals to following quarters. Taking a step back, the company’s evolving AI story should not be overlooked as it is integrated across the company’s sprawling suite of cloud and digital assets.” Overall, CRM ranks 8th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
