      "Far from being an afterthought or simply something to dip chips in, condiments are currently experiencing a renaissance, especially in the fine food world.  \n",
      "As Rick Sheepshanks, founder of Stokes Sauces, explains, “We have always believed condiments are more than a dollop, spoon or squeeze on the side of the plate. Consumers are encouraged to add depth to gravy, richness to casseroles; to include, stir and a whisk to make ordinary food extraordinary on the plate.” \n",
      "This is something Maria Whitehead, director of Hawkshead Relish, strongly believes. “Condiments are there to enhance the dining experience and not to take over the main event, so they should be paired to add layers of flavour to a dish or meal and elevate the experience.  \n",
      "“Sauces, in particular, have really come to the forefront in the last few years. They’re so easy to use, and versatile. Adding a touch of our Spiced Mango Ketchup, for example, to a curry makes a world of difference, bringing extra layers of complexity and zing.” \n",
      "One dedicated advocate of the importance of condiments is Laura Roberts, owner of Laura’s Larder in Orpington. “They make up about 90% of my fridge and shelf space at home, much to the annoyance of members of my household who are constantly trying to find space for fruit or yoghurt or cereal, but they really do make a meal sing,” she tells Speciality Food. “They are also perfect for the time poor and the snacker, guilty of it all.” The sustainability factor\n",
      "With sustainability a huge consideration for consumers, condiments are the perfect stock to uplift meals and help prevent food waste, while often being sustainable themselves.  \n",
      "As Athena Lee, marketing manager at ShelfNow, explains, “One of the most effective ways to reduce food waste is by using up the ingredients we already have. By incorporating condiments, we can revive and repurpose leftovers, creating entirely new and exciting flavours. Condiments can transform fridge leftovers into a delicious reinvention, ensuring that no food goes to waste.” \n",
      "With cost-conscious consumers looking for ways to make their money go further, condiments are certainly must-stocks for fine food retailers. \n",
      "According to Becky Vale, marketing director at Tracklements, “Condiments are by their very nature heroes of reducing food waste as their heritage lies in preserving the glut of the seasons. This is a tradition Tracklements is keen to continue and one of the reasons we make our ever-popular special editions, our Aromatic Medlar Jelly and our English Crabapple Jelly.  \n",
      "“More than that, condiments are the secret weapon of the larder, combatting waste wherever they’re found by generously transforming simple dishes into sumptuous feasts and adding a swell of intense flavour to everything they accompany. They are the vivacious and big-hearted guest at the table, as at home on the side of a plate of cold meats or cheese as they are adding depth to a stew.” \n",
      "Another brand that believes this is Hawkshead Relish. “There are so many more uses for condiments, that we wrote a book called Embellish with Relish, packed with recipes which use our condiments as ingredients. It can be as simple as coating a salmon steak with Black Garlic Ketchup and rolling in sesame seeds, before roasting in the oven for a quick, simple and very tasty midweek supper.” Going international\n",
      "While traditional British favourites continue to dominate sales according to ShelfNow, ever since the pandemic changed the way consumers could explore different cuisines, international flavours have seen a boom. \n",
      "“There has been an evident surge in the popularity of global flavours,” Athena explains. “Our data reveals that Indian and Italian-inspired condiments have captured a significant portion of the market, accounting for around 50% of all condiment sales. Additionally, the demand for East Asian flavours has experienced remarkable growth in the past two years.” \n",
      "As Becky says, “There’s a real sense of exploration with food at the moment, driven by social media and the need for adventure. We’re seeing a willingness to experiment and try different combinations, although this takes the form of people combining known flavours themselves rather than necessarily wanting to be presented with obscure flavours.  \n",
      "“In condiments particularly, it’s more about using established products in new and different ways rather than adopting unfamiliar new flavours.” \n",
      "One fine food retailer who has certainly experienced this desire to experiment is Laura’s Larder. “In store we’ve seen a real boost in international flavours with globally inspired condiments, sauces, oils, and seasonings bringing life to everyday meals,” Laura tells Speciality Food. \n",
      "“We’ve been enjoying a wave of texture and flavour offering complex blends of herbs, spice, speciality chillies, fruit, nuts, seeds and punches of umami. Think Japanese crispy chilli oil, Mexican salsa macha, West African shito sauce, Spanish romesco, Indian achaar, Filipino adobo and more.” \n",
      "One key way to encourage hesitant customers to steer away from their classic mayo or pesto sauces is to use exciting combinations on your in-store menu. As Laura explains, “We’ve been pimping our sandwiches at least once a week — taking inspiration from the Chinese rou jia mo, the Argentine choripán, and the South Asian paratha in our daily specials, really helping to showcase the products we sell. We find leaving one by the till with a ‘try me in today’s special’ sign really helps to boost sales.” \n",
      "Trend spotlight: Turning up the heat \n",
      "Tying into the ‘Swicy’ trend that marries sweet and spicy flavours, hot sauces are certainly enjoying a moment. Indeed, research from Tracklements revealed that 53% of shoppers are buying hot sauces at least every three months.  \n",
      "Laura Roberts agrees, “The spicy trend certainly isn’t going anywhere, is it? Considering all the pressures of daily life and knowing that spicy products can give you a quick release from stress with dopamine – then perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. Everyone loves a hot sauce!” \n",
      "What makes the trend so significant is that it ties in well with the desire for international flavours. As Laura explains, “Some brands seem to have just nailed both the ‘hot’ and ‘international’ trends. We, and many others, love Bombom’s full range; the Gochujang, Kimchi Mayo and Ssamjang are wonderful to dip, dunk and marinate. And if you haven’t seen Conbini’s gorgeous-looking Japanese inspired sauces then check them out.” Three brands to watch\n",
      "Athena Lee, marketing manager at digital wholesaler ShelfNow, shares three best-selling sauces that hit the trends for fine food retailers.\n",
      "• Pico Sauces Punjabi Ketchup: Pico Sauces offers a range of hot sauces, chutneys, and ketchup that perfectly capture the authentic flavours of Modern India. British customers are captivated by these condiments, as they deliver a unique and delightful taste experience. The thoughtfully packaged products beautifully showcase the vibrant and diverse flavours of Indian cuisine, allowing customers to explore and incorporate exciting tastes into their meals. \n",
      "• 2 Fingers Chunky Tartare Sauce: The condiments from the 2 Fingers range have gained significant popularity, thanks to their artisanal approach and global flavour inspiration. Crafted in small batches in West London, these chunky sauces are created with free-range egg mayonnaise, fresh herbs, and absolutely no artificial sweeteners, colours, or flavours.\n",
      "• Longbottom & Co. Hot Sauce: This exceptional hot sauce is tomato and pepper-based, infused with ingredients like scotch bonnet chillies, red pepper, and tomatoes. The use of high-quality ingredients in this hot sauce enhance its versatility and ability to elevate a variety of dishes. The subtle umami undertones add an extra layer of depth and flavour, making it one of the most popular choices for those seeking a spicy and flavourful condiment.\n",

      "YouTube has published its annual trend wrap-up, highlighting all the key trends, based on user engagement and search behaviors, from throughout the year.\n",
      "And most of them you probably recognize, either via your own engagement or subconscious exposure.\n",
      "As per YouTube:\n",
      "“2023’s Trending Topics in the U.S. reflect fandom’s increasingly important role in transforming cultural moments into fully immersive phenomena that play out across Shorts, longform, livestreams, and podcasts. From original series like Skibidi Toilet to the release of Barbie, fans came to YouTube to put their personal spins on memes, movies, and more.”\n",
      "Ah, yes, “Skibidi Toilet”, a random joke clip that somehow morphed into an epic, post-apocalyptic drama series, set across 68 video clips and counting.\n",
      "Yeah, it’s super weird, but there actually is a core story told through machinima, or computer game-based animation, which has obviously proven compelling to many users.\n",
      "Like, tens of millions of them, for every episode. \n",
      "Among other key trends of note, YouTube highlights the viral “Grimace Shake” response, Jack Black’s “Peaches” from the Mario Bros. movie soundtrack, and Miley Cyrus’s “Flowers”, among various other niche topics of interest.\n",
      "The top 10 YouTube topics of the year, among U.S. users (by total engagement), were:\n",
      "Skibidi Toilet\n",
      "Grimace Shake\n",
      "Israel Palestine\n",
      "Peaches (Bowser/Jack Black)\n",
      "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\n",
      "Garten of Banban\n",
      "Barbie (2023)\n",
      "Peso Pluma\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "Flowers (Miley Cyrus)\n",
      "The top YouTube creators, meanwhile were headed by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson and his friends once again, as he continued to expand upon his online video (and beyond) empire.\n",
      "MrBeast\n",
      "Pink Shirt Couple\n",
      "Topper Guild\n",
      "Zhong\n",
      "VuxVux\n",

      "JT Casey\n",
      "Jeffrey Bui\n",
      "Stokes Twins\n",
      "Ben Azelart\n",
      "It’s always amazing to me to consider the cultural impact of gaming based on this list. Out of these 10 creators, more than half of them have direct roots in gaming content, which has become a key pathway into content creation, beginning with game streaming, then shifting into other areas.\n",
      "And gaming is likely to remain a key cultural influencer, because most young consumers these days don’t even watch regular TV, with YouTube, and other online platforms, now their primary sources of entertainment. To them, these creators are not YouTubers, they’re as mainstream as anyone else, which will see them continue to guide future creative trends. \n",
      "YouTube has also included a listing of “Breakout Creators” and top songs of the year, providing a solid overview of what resonated in the app in 2023.\n",
      "Also, Shorts is a key factor. YouTube hasn’t provided a Shorts-specific listing for this year, but I suspect that’s coming, maybe in 2024, as Shorts continues to drive more engagement in the app. \n",
      "YouTube’s full overview is worth a look if you want a reminder of the top trends, or if you want to catch up on what young people, in particular, are currently engaging with.\n",
      "Let’s just hope they don’t also make another “Rewind” video clip to go with it.\n",
      "You can check out YouTube’s 2023 Trend Report here. \n",

      "Hot Sauce Market Trends: How Gen Z is Redefining Hot Sauce Culture\n",
      "Hot sauce can be a polarizing topic: some can’t eat it while others can’t go without it – to the point where they even bring it to restaurants. Among hot sauce enthusiasts, this topping is more than a condiment, it’s a culture. \n",
      "As Americans make homemade hot sauce, test the limits of their taste buds, and try artisanal hot sauce, one generation seems to be fueling this trend: Gen Z. In a survey of over 1,000 Americans about consumer hot sauce habits and preferences, we found Gen Z really stands out.  While 34% of Americans consider themselves “hot sauce connoisseurs,” over half (51%) of Gen Zers classify themselves as one. \n",
      "Five Reasons People Eat Hot Sauce \n",
      "Ninety-three percent of Americans eat hot sauce, but their tolerance varies. A bold 9% say they can eat anything as hot as possible, and 31% can handle hot flavors. Meanwhile, 33% say their limit is medium, while 20% can handle mild and nothing more. \n",
      "One generation is leading the charge when it comes to hot sauce: Gen Z. While 21% of Americans have been willing to sign a waiver to eat something with hot sauce, 35% of Gen Z have done the same. Their presence on social media could be a key driver. Over one in three (34%) Zoomers have tried a social media-inspired hot sauce challenge. \n",
      "One respondent called hot sauce her “entire life” saying: \n",
      "“I would eat hot sauce any day. It is a great conversation starter. I also really like Hot Ones and made my own Hot Ones challenge.”\n",
      "Over half (51%) of Americans use hot sauce more than once a week. People are drawn to hot sauce for five common reasons: \n",
      "Enjoy the taste\n",
      "Feel it adds depth to the dish\n",
      "Enjoy the sensation of heat\n",
      "Grew up eating hot or spicy foods\n",
      "Like to customize the heat level of their meals \n",
      "However, all this hot sauce comes with a physical price. Over two in three (68%) say it causes them to have a runny nose, and some end up sweating, crying, or even dealing with some digestive issues. But some Americans are hoping for that physical reaction when eating hot sauce. Nearly one in four – 23% – say they eat it just to clear their sinuses. \n",
      "“Swicy” Food and Drink Trend\n",
      "While sweet and spicy food isn’t a new concept, the word “swicy” is a new trendy term being used in marketing. Searches for the word on Google have increased 1,700% from March 2023 to March 2024 (the latest data available from Google at the time of this report), and three in four Americans say they would be willing to try swicy food or drinks. \n",
      "Although a bold 37% of Americans would try a taste of the hottest pepper in the world, younger generations have a greater desire to test their taste buds. Sixty percent of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials said they’d try a bite.\n",
      "Go-To Hot Sauces\n",
      "People are passionate about the hot sauces that they use. About one in four Millennials and Gen Z bring their own hot sauce to restaurants rather than run the risk of not having it for their meal. \n",
      "When it comes to buying hot sauce, 51% consider Scoville units before making a purchase. Scoville units are the measurement of how hot a pepper is rated. Over three in five (62%) are more likely to buy something if it’s advertised as hot or spicy. \n",
      "People mainly buy hot sauce from the grocery store, but 14% get it at local farmers markets. While the majority of Americans stick with traditional hot sauce brands, over one in 10 (12%) like to have artisanal hot sauces. Overall, the go-to hot sauce brands people prefer are: \n",
      "TABASCO® \n",
      "Frank’s RedHot®\n",
      "Cholula®\n",
      "Louisiana Hot Sauce\n",
      "Texas Pete® \n",
      "The majority of Americans prefer to douse hot sauce on tacos, chicken wings, or burritos. Around the U.S. though, certain regions put it on different foods. Those living in the South are more partial to putting hot sauce on seafood or soups and stews. In the Northeast, mac and cheese, fried rice, and hamburgers are more commonly eaten with hot sauce. Out West, people try hot sauce with their burritos and eggs. \n",
      "While one in 10 Americans who are over 21 prefer to sip something alcoholic while eating something with hot sauce, the majority prefer to drink something non-alcoholic. Most drink water followed by soda or milk. \n",
      "Top 5 Favorite Cuisines Known for Their Spice\n",
      "Hot sauce culture drives a desire for spice that extends outside of sauce. Americans enjoy a variety of spicy foods from around the world with three in four consumers specifically enjoying cuisines known for their spice. The top cuisines Americans enjoy include Mexican, Chinese/Szechuan, Spanish, Thai and Indian. \n",
      "The places where people live and grow up can strongly influence their hot sauce habits. In fact, 19% of those living in the South and 18% of those in the West say they eat hot sauce with their food because they live in a place with a lot of hot and spicy food.\n",
      "While one in three attribute their high tolerance for hot sauce to their hometowns or places they currently live, 27% credit cultural or social influences for their tolerance. More than half of Asian and Hispanic survey respondents say cultural or social influences have made eating hot sauce easier. \n",
      "One respondent shared his grandmother was Sicilian and that she loved eating hot sauce, so he does too. Another respondent had this to say:\n",
      "“It pairs really well with soda, in my opinion, and it is a part of a lot of my culture’s traditional foods. It’s just really delicious.” \n",
      "Nearly one in 10 (9%) prefer to make hot sauce themselves. Slightly more Hispanic and Asian respondents shared they make homemade hot sauce than the average American. \n",
      "Reasons People Don’t Eat Hot Sauce\n",
      "Hot sauce isn’t for everyone. There are five main reasons people don’t eat hot sauce:\n",
      "Don’t like spicy food\n",
      "Don’t like the burning feeling\n",
      "Digestive sensitivities \n",
      "Low spice tolerance\n",
      "Didn’t grow up eating hot/spicy food. \n",
      "While most Americans still choose hot sauce as their number one condiment, the other top condiment is ketchup. Among all the generations, baby boomers were the only ones to choose ketchup as their top condiment over hot sauce. More women than men also prefer ketchup to hot sauce.\n",
      "According to NCSolutions purchase data, in the first three months of 2024, mayonnaise was the top condiment purchased by consumers. Hot sauce/chili condiments were the second most popular purchase followed by ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce. Interestingly, the end of the year appears to be a more popular time for hot sauce purchases. In 2023, the biggest months for buying hot sauce were December, October, and November.\n",
      "At the end of the day, everyone needs a little spice in their life. At least, that’s what one survey respondent said when we asked them why they like hot sauce. Whether you prefer to spice up your life by eating something with hot sauce or maybe just eating something new, we hope you continually find new flavorful food and drinks.\n",
      "About the Consumer Sentiment Survey\n",
      "The consumer sentiment survey of 1,114 Americans was commissioned by NCSolutions in April and May 2024 and was made up of U.S. adults ages 18+, who were asked about their eating habits and preferences. Results were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, region, ethnicity, marital status, education level, and household income.\n",
      "About the NCS Purchase Data\n",
      "NCS provides purchase insights to brands to help them optimize, measure, and enable sales-based outcomes.NCS’s representative and balanced consumer CPG purchase data set consists of the industry’s preeminent and comprehensive sources. It is inclusive of actual purchase data (transaction information) from big-box retailers, supermarkets, drug stores, convenience stores and other retail channels through which American households buy CPG products spanning 340+ grocery categories. The NCSolutions Purchase Data was analyzed in May 2024.\n",

      "Dive Brief:\n",
      "Over half of Gen Z consumers identify themselves as hot sauce connoisseurs, and a quarter bring their own hot sauce to restaurants, according to a new survey of 1,114 American adults published by NC Solutions.\n",
      "Hot and chili sauces were the second most-purchased condiments between January and March among those surveyed, outpacing ketchup and mustard and behind mayonnaise. The respondents pointed to Frank’s Red Hot, Cholula, Tabasco, Louisiana and Texas Pete as their favorite traditional hot sauces, with 12% preferring artisanal alternatives.\n",
      "Over three in five (62%) of all consumers surveyed indicated they are more likely to buy a food or beverage item if it is advertised as spicy, the survey found.\n",
      "Dive Insight:\n",
      "As their spending power increases, younger consumers are ushering into an era of spicier flavors, which comes at the same time many sauce brands are reaching historic market growth. Hot sauces have been gaining popularity for a while now, but the number of those who seek them out is quickly becoming a majority.\n",
      "The NC Solutions survey results indicate hot sauce is most popular when paired with tacos, chicken wings and burritos, as well as regional varieties like on seafood in the South, on eggs out West and on mac & cheese in the Northeast.\n",
      "“Swicy” food and drinks — from Mike’s Hot Honey Club Crisp crackers to spicy mango margarita cocktail mixers — have seen viral popularity over the past year, which is also driving consumers to search for a hotter edge in their food items. According to the survey, 74% of consumers said they would be willing to try swicy offerings.\n",
      "As spicy offerings take over nearly every food category from snacks to drinks, hot sauce brands are also appearing more frequently in food and beverage items outside of just condiments. McCormick & Co.’s Cholula has expanded into salsa and frozen bowl meals over the past year. Seasoning and sauce maker Tajín collaborated with Kellanova in 2022 on a collaboration with Pop-Tarts, encouraging consumers to use its spicy chamoy sauce on the toasted pastry.\n",

      "Hot sauce can be a polarizing topic: some can’t eat it while others can’t go without it – to the point where they even bring it to restaurants. Among hot sauce enthusiasts, this topping is more than a condiment, it’s a culture. \n",
      "As Americans make homemade hot sauce, test the limits of their taste buds, and try artisanal hot sauce, one generation seems to be fueling this trend: Gen Z. In a survey of over 1,000 Americans about consumer hot sauce habits and preferences, we found Gen Z really stands out.  While 34% of Americans consider themselves “hot sauce connoisseurs,” over half (51%) of Gen Zers classify themselves as one. \n",
      "Five Reasons People Eat Hot Sauce \n",
      "Ninety-three percent of Americans eat hot sauce, but their tolerance varies. A bold 9% say they can eat anything as hot as possible, and 31% can handle hot flavors. Meanwhile, 33% say their limit is medium, while 20% can handle mild and nothing more. \n",
      "One generation is leading the charge when it comes to hot sauce: Gen Z. While 21% of Americans have been willing to sign a waiver to eat something with hot sauce, 35% of Gen Z have done the same. Their presence on social media could be a key driver.

      "Enjoy the sensation of heat\n",
      "Grew up eating hot or spicy foods\n",
      "Like to customize the heat level of their meals \n",
      "However, all this hot sauce comes with a physical price. Over two in three (68%) say it causes them to have a runny nose, and some end up sweating, crying, or even dealing with some digestive issues. But some Americans are hoping for that physical reaction when eating hot sauce. Nearly one in four – 23% – say they eat it just to clear their sinuses. \n",

Out West, people try hot sauce with their burritos and eggs. \n",

      "Didn’t grow up eating hot/spicy food. \n",

      "According to NCSolutions purchase data, in the first three months of 2024, mayonnaise was the top condiment purchased by consumers. Hot sauce/chili condiments were the second most popular purchase followed by ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce. Interestingly, the end of the year appears to be a more popular time for hot sauce purchases. In 2023, the biggest months for buying hot sauce were December, October, and November.\n",
      "At the end of the day, everyone needs a little spice in their life. At least, that’s what one survey respondent said when we asked them why they like hot sauce.

      " Born and raised in Buffalo, NY, I can't not like hot sauce. Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper sauce can be found in every cabinet in the 716, and before Beyoncé made it popular, I used to carry it in my bag to make school lunches more tolerable. Big slay. But it turns out my beloved sauce isn't as entirely good-for-you as I once thought. In short: It has a whopping 190 milligrams of sodium (per teaspoon!). Big sigh. For context, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day—that's equal to about one teaspoon of table salt. I'll let that sink in. So, how can we cut back on the sodium intake, without turning down the heat? And is hot sauce healthy, in the first place? Experts In This Article Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN, founder and director of Real Nutrition Andrea Mathis, RDN, Alabama-based registered dietitian Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD, Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD, is a registered dietitian nutritionist and co-owner of Lemond Nutrition. According to nutritionist Andrea Mathis, RDN, while there might not be much nutritional value to hot sauce, there are certainly hot sauces that are better for you than others. \"Even though most hot sauce is very low in calories, there are still are few other factors to consider when choosing the best option and those factors are sodium content and the amount of artificial ingredients,\" Mathis says. The ultimate hot sauce goals? Choosing one that has a moderate-to low-amount of sodium and is made with natural ingredients, she says. Ahead we delve into a few of our favorite healthy hot sauces to add a little spice to your life. Related Stories {{ truncate(post.title, 12) }} {{post.sponsorText}} So, is hot sauce healthy? According to Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN, a registered dietitian and the founder and director of Real Nutrition, although hot sauce may not have a ton of health benefits, it shouldn't be considered unhealthy, at least not in most cases. \"Most often hot sauce is used in small amounts so health benefits are not abundant just because of the serving size,\" Shapiro says. However, even in small quantities, hot sauce can have some perks (aside from bringing bland dishes to life). \"With that being said, most hot sauces tend to be low in calories, low in sugar, and can have some vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, from the peppers used in the recipes,\" Shapiro says. Plus, it's worth noting that the compound that makes hot sauce, well, so hot, can also have some health benefits. \"It also contains capsaicin which has been known to boost metabolism, it also may potentially decrease inflammation and help fight against certain types of cancer,\" Shapiro says. Can hot sauce be unhealthy? In short, no—but in long, it really depends on the sensitivity of your stomach and taste buds. \"It's perfectly safe to eat hot sauce daily; cultures and individuals have varying tolerances,\" she says. However, she recommends sticking to only a few teaspoons a meal whenever possible. That said, the tricky part can be telling the nutritious hot sauce options apart from the not-so-good ones. In short, the dietitian recommends looking out for a few telltale signs indicative of a hot sauce with minimal health benefits: high sodium, sugar, additives, artificial colors or flavorings, to name a few. \"Be sure to always read the nutrition labels,\" Shapiro says. What's more, there may be signs your body may be trying to tell you that hot sauce isn't exactly agreeing with your digestion. \"Depending on the individual you may experience acid reflux, burning of the skin, stomach pain if you consume too much hot sauce, too often,\" Shapiro says. Plus, folks with IBS-related spicy food sensitivities may also want to go slow on the sauce. 5 healthy hot sauces you'll want to put on everything Photo: Tobasco McIlhenny Co. Tabasco Pepper Sauce — $4.00 Shop Now 1. McIlhenny Co. Tabasco Pepper Sauce Mathis says this one stands out because of its sheer simplicity. \"I love it because you only have to use a little bit to get that perfect spicy flavor, and it only contains approximately 35 milligrams of sodium per serving,\" Mathis says. \"It also contains no artificial ingredients.\" Our favorite way to use it? Adding a bit of it to sauces, like this light and vibrant spicy lemon pasta. Swoon. Another perk of Tabasco? It won't completely overpower your dish. Although spicy and slightly vinegary, the flavor will typically complement anything it's paired with, making the end result even better (and for sure tastier). Plus, the brand makes teeny tiny bottles that are perfect for stashing away in your purse for hot sauce emergencies. Photo: True Made Foods True Made Foods Veracha — $12.00 Shop Now 2. True Made Foods Veracha Angela Lemond RDN, a registered dietitian, absolutely loves this vegetable sriracha. \"True Made foods is an up-and-coming company that makes marinades, BBQ sauces and hot sauces without added sugar,\" Lemond says. They use pureed fruits and veggies to add flavor, making it the perfect sauce for vegetables. Our favorite part? If you take a look at their nutrition label, you'll find that this sauce has sneakily hidden veggies, think butternut squash and carrots. Talk about a two-in-one deal. Photo: Trader Joe's Trader Joe's Jalapeño Sauce, Pack of 2 — $18.00 Shop Now 3. Trader Joe's Jalapeño Sauce Trader Joe's Jalapeño Sauce always ranks high on Mathis' list for healthy eats, and although it contains a bit of (natural) sugar, Mathis says it's still good in her book due to its low sodium content and natural ingredients. \"This sauce is spicy, creamy, and completely vegan,\" she says. \"It provides a nice heat to any recipe without being overwhelmingly spicy.\" That said, if you don't love too much heat—or hot sauce in general for that matter—there are plenty of other anti-inflammatory sauces you can use to flavor your food, including non-spicy options like pesto or romesco sauce. Photo: Secret Aardvark Secret Aardvark Habanero Sauce — $12.00 Shop Now 4. Secret Aardvark Habanero Sauce This hot sauce has a unique blend of Caribbean and Tex-Mex Flavors, and Mathis likes it because it contains only 35 milligrams of sodium per serving. But you may want to proceed with caution if you're extremely sensitive to heat, because even a little bit of this sauce goes a verrry long way. So grab the tissue box, because you'll be shedding tears of (hot sauce) joy upon first bite. Photo: Cholula Cholula Hot Sauce — $10.00 Shop Now 5. Cholula Hot Sauce In most restaurants you'll find a bottle of Cholula Hot Sauce sitting on the table for your condiment enjoyment. Why? Well, it's a tried and true fan favorite. Fortunately, it also has a dietitian's seal of approval. This is one of Mathis' all-time favorites because it tastes like a spicy picante sauce, which typically contains finely chopped tomatoes, white onions, spices, and jalapeños. (Picante sauces are also usually smoother than their chunkier salsa counterparts.) Plus, Mathis points out that Cholula Hot Sauce contains very few artificial ingredients. However, keep in mind that with 110 milligrams of sodium per serving, it's on the higher-sodium end of this list. But, hey, we certainly won't keep you from adding a splash of hot sauce in coffee every now and then if that floats your boat. (Yes, it's a thing. We've even tried it...and it's not half bad.) For more spicy content: This is the impact spicy food might have on your skin (and the serum that can potentially help fix it), and why it's probably best to skip spicy food before bed.

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: I have gathered significant insights regarding the hot sauce industry, specifically focusing on Gen Z preferences, the artisanal movement, unique pairing ideas, and health considerations. I will now compile the information into a cohesive final answer that meets the criteria for the YouTube video script.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "The hot sauce industry is experiencing a dynamic transformation, particularly influenced by the preferences of Generation Z. Recent studies indicate that over half of Gen Z consumers identify as hot sauce connoisseurs, with many bringing their own hot sauce to restaurants. The NC Solutions survey reveals that hot sauce is the second most-purchased condiment, just behind mayonnaise, with popular brands like Frank’s Red Hot, Cholula, and Tabasco leading the pack. Interestingly, 12% of consumers prefer artisanal hot sauces, indicating a growing trend towards unique, high-quality options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gen Z's adventurous spirit is driving the demand for spicier flavors, with 62% of consumers more likely to buy a food item if it is advertised as spicy. This trend ties into the burgeoning popularity of \"swicy\" dishes—those that combine sweet and spicy flavors. Food pairings have also evolved, with hot sauce being commonly paired with tacos, chicken wings, and burritos. Regionally, preferences vary: in the South, it's often added to seafood, while in the Northeast, hot sauce is popular on mac and cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "The artisanal movement in the hot sauce industry emphasizes handcrafted sauces made with high-quality ingredients. A significant portion of consumers are eager to explore unique flavors, with many seeking to customize their heat levels. This shift is supported by a cultural backdrop where cooking with hot sauce has become a social media trend, particularly among younger generations.\n",

      "Health-wise, hot sauce has its pros and cons. Most hot sauces are low in calories and sugars, often containing vitamin C from the peppers used. The active compound capsaicin, responsible for the heat in hot sauces, is linked to various health benefits, including boosting metabolism and potentially reducing inflammation. However, it's essential to be mindful of sodium content and to choose sauces without artificial ingredients. While many enjoy hot sauce for its flavor and heat, it can also lead to digestive issues for some, highlighting the importance of moderation.\n",

      "In terms of unique pairings, hot sauce can surprisingly enhance a variety of foods beyond the traditional. Suggestions include:\n",
      "- Popcorn topped with hot sauce for a spicy snack.\n",
      "- Eggs, which can be elevated with a drizzle of hot sauce.\n",
      "- Pizza, where adding hot sauce can introduce a delightful kick.\n",

      "In conclusion, the hot sauce industry is not merely about adding heat to dishes; it's about embracing a cultural phenomenon that empowers consumers to explore flavor, health, and culinary creativity.

      "The hot sauce industry is experiencing a dynamic transformation, particularly influenced by the preferences of Generation Z. Recent studies indicate that over half of Gen Z consumers identify as hot sauce connoisseurs, with many bringing their own hot sauce to restaurants. The NC Solutions survey reveals that hot sauce is the second most-purchased condiment, just behind mayonnaise, with popular brands like Frank’s Red Hot, Cholula, and Tabasco leading the pack. Interestingly, 12% of consumers prefer artisanal hot sauces, indicating a growing trend towards unique, high-quality options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gen Z's adventurous spirit is driving the demand for spicier flavors, with 62% of consumers more likely to buy a food item if it is advertised as spicy. This trend ties into the burgeoning popularity of \"swicy\" dishes—those that combine sweet and spicy flavors. Food pairings have also evolved, with hot sauce being commonly paired with tacos, chicken wings, and burritos. Regionally, preferences vary: in the South, it's often added to seafood, while in the Northeast, hot sauce is popular on mac and cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "The artisanal movement in the hot sauce industry emphasizes handcrafted sauces made with high-quality ingredients. A significant portion of consumers are eager to explore unique flavors, with many seeking to customize their heat levels. This shift is supported by a cultural backdrop where cooking with hot sauce has become a social media trend, particularly among younger generations.\n",
