   - 1 cucumber, diced  
   - 2 large tomatoes, diced  
   - 1 bell pepper, diced  
   - 1 red onion, thinly sliced  
   - 1 cup Kalamata olives  
   - 1 cup feta cheese (or a plant-based feta for a vegan option), crumbled  
   - 4 tablespoons olive oil  
   - 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  
   - Salt and pepper, to taste  

3. **For the Tzatziki Sauce:**  
   - 1 cup Greek yogurt (or a plant-based yogurt)  
   - 1 cucumber, grated and excess water squeezed out  
   - 2 garlic cloves, minced  
   - 1 tablespoon olive oil  
   - 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried)  
   - Salt, to taste  

**Preparation Instructions:**  
1. **Prepare the Vegetarian Moussaka:**  
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Set aside on paper towels to drain.  
   - In the same skillet, add more olive oil if needed and sauté the onion until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.  
   - Add the cooked lentils, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15 minutes.  
   - In a separate pot, boil the potato slices in salted water for about 5 minutes until slightly tender. Drain and set aside.  
   - In a greased baking dish, layer half of the potato slices on the bottom, then half of the eggplant slices, followed by the lentil mixture. Repeat the layers, finishing with the remaining eggplant.  
   - Pour the béchamel sauce over the top and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.  
   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it sit for 10 minutes before serving.  

2. **Prepare the Greek Salad:**  
   - In a large bowl, combine chopped romaine, cucumber, tomatoes, bell pepper, red onion, and olives.  
   - In a separate small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently.  
   - Top with crumbled feta cheese (or plant-based feta) before serving.  

3. **Prepare the Tzatziki Sauce:**  
   - In a medium bowl, combine Greek yogurt (or plant-based yogurt), grated cucumber, minced garlic, olive oil, dill, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.  

**Serving Suggestions:**  
- Serve the Vegetarian Moussaka hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.  
- Present the Greek Salad in a large bowl or divided among individual plates, with extra feta on the side.  
- Serve the Tzatziki sauce in a small bowl as a dip alongside the Moussaka or as a dressing for the salad.  
- Pair with warm pita bread and a glass of light red wine or ouzo for an authentic Greek experience. Enjoy your delightful Greek dinner with family and friends!

**Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:**  
- **Ground Beef or Lamb to Lentils:** Lentils are a great plant-based source of protein and provide a hearty texture, ensuring the dish remains filling and flavorful.  
- **Parmesan Cheese to Vegetarian Parmesan:** This maintains the cheesy flavor while ensuring the dish is vegetarian-friendly.  
- **Feta Cheese to Plant-Based Feta (optional):** For a vegan option, using plant-based feta preserves the tangy flavor profile while accommodating dietary restrictions.  
- **Greek Yogurt to Plant-Based Yogurt (optional):** This substitution keeps the creaminess of the tzatziki sauce while offering a dairy-free option.  
- **Béchamel Sauce:** Ensure that the béchamel sauce is made with plant-based milk for a completely vegetarian version.  

This recipe retains the essence of traditional Greek Moussaka while being a healthy and satisfying vegetarian alternative. Enjoy!
