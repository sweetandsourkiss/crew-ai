      "   - Spread a layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo. Repeat layers, alternating between phyllo and walnut mixture, ending with 8 layers of phyllo on top.\n",
      "   - Cut the baklava into diamond shapes before baking. Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden and crisp.\n",
      "   - While the baklava is baking, combine water, honey (or agave syrup), and vanilla in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.\n",

      "- Serve the Greek salad on the side, drizzled with extra olive oil if desired.\n",
